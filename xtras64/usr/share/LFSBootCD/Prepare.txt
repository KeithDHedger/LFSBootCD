Live CD based heavily on this:
https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/~purschke/RescueCD/
Thanks!

The system (/) is in a RAM disk, for this help it is assumed the cd will be mounted on /cdrom and the partion for the new LFS system is /dev/sda1, alter as needed.
The cdrom data may or may not be mounted, so if /cdrom is empty/not a mountpoint then you need to mount the cd manually eg:

mount /dev/sr0 /cdrom

Use fdisk to create a partition table, a partition for LFS etc if needed on the hard drive, WARNING if your hard drive has already has a partition table be careful not to create a new one as it will delete all partions on the drive , BACKUP YOUR DATA!!!!

fdisk /devsda
...
Create partition table etc
...

Format partition for new install of LFS if needed, eg:

mke2fs -L MyNewLFS /dev/sda1

Create a suitable mount point ( /mnt/LFS should already exist unless somthing went wrong ), mount the partition, and cd into it, eg:

mkdir -vp /mnt/LFS
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/LFS
cd /mnt/LFS

Either copy the need files in /cdrom/LFS or use the setup script:

/cdrom/LFS/LFSSetUp

Change to the LFSScripts folder and follow the Howto, but skip section 1),2),4) as the needed files are already in place in the source archives folder.
