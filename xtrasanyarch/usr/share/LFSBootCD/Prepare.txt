Live CD based heavily on this:
https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/~purschke/RescueCD/
Thanks!

The system (/) is in a RAM disk, for this help it is assumed the cd will be mounted on /cdrom and the partition for the new LFS system is /dev/sda2 mounted on /mnt/LFS with swap on /dev/sda1, alter as needed.

The cdrom data may or may not be mounted, so if /cdrom is empty/not a mountpoint then you need to mount the cd manually eg:
All these commands must be run as root.

mount /dev/sr0 /cdrom

Use fdisk to create a partition table, a partition for LFS etc if needed on the hard drive, WARNING if your hard drive already has a partition table be careful not to create a new one as it will delete all partitions on the drive , BACKUP YOUR DATA!!!!

fdisk /dev/sda
...
Create partition table etc
...

You can use this line ( best to copy/paste ) to write the partion table all in one got, THIS WILL DELETE YOUR CURRENT PARTITION SCHEME, be warned.
This will set up two partitions the 1st ( /dev/sda1 ) being a 6G swap the rest ( /dev/sda2 ) of the disk is used for LFS

printf "o\nn\np\n1\n\n+6G\nt\n82\nn\np\n2\n\n\nt\n2\n83\nw\n\n"|fdisk /dev/sda 2>/dev/null >/dev/null
 
Format partition for new install of LFS if needed, eg:

mke2fs -L MyNewLFS /dev/sda2

Create swap space if needed and turn on:

mkswap /dev/sda1
swapon /dev/sda1

Create a suitable mount point ( /mnt/LFS should already exist unless something went wrong ), mount the partition, and cd into it, eg:

mkdir -vp /mnt/LFS
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/LFS
cd /mnt/LFS

Run the setup script to copy needed files etc, mostly you can just hit enter to accept the defaults, but you will probably have to change the gateway IP, enter y at the end to complete the transfer:

LFSSetUp

Change to the LFSScripts folder:
cd /mnt/LFS/LFSScripts

Run Build File System script:
./BuildFileSystem

Include the data set up previously
. SystemData

Create a link from downloaded linux tarball to /LFSSourceArchives/$LFSVERSION/KERNEL to prevent re-downloading source tarball.
mkdir  /mnt/LFS/LFSSourceArchives/$LFSVERSION/KERNEL
pushd /mnt/LFS/LFSSourceArchives/$LFSVERSION/KERNEL
	ln -sv ../SYSTEM/linux-$KERNELVERSION.tar.xz linux-$KERNELVERSION.tar.xz
popd

Chroot into temporary system:
./Chroot system

lfspkg/BuildFileSystem now creates an unprivileged user for certain actions eg extracting tarballs.
/LFSSourceArchives and /LFSBuiltPackages should now have the group set to lfspkguser, and perms set to 775, if you want your normal user to have access just add yourself to the lfspkguser group.
You will have to re-own/set perms the various folders etc, so:
chown -R $USER:lfspkguser /LFSSourceArchives /LFSBuiltPackages
chmod -R g+rwx /LFSSourceArchives/ /LFSBuiltPackages/

You should now be in the chroot.
First install lfspkg:
The LFSPkg build script will decide whether to do an install or upgrade.
cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/admin/LFSPkg
BOOTSTRAP=1 ./LFSPkg.LFSBuild
You WILL get errors about wget not being installed etc, ignore them for now, lfspkg will be re-installed after the base system has been built/installed.

As part of the LFSSetUp script /root/.lfspkg.rc has been created to contain basic info needed by lfspkg, review and change if needed.
You can use lfspkg itself to create the users lfspkg.rc file by using:
lfspkg --setup

Set /mnt/LFS/etc/lfspkg.rc or /mnt/LFS/root/.lfspkg.rc (preferred) variables, make sure the SOURCEARCHIVES points to the same place as $SOURCEARCHIVES from SystemData.local as that's where the main LFS system source files are, you can do this either from in the chroot environment or from the host with root permissions.

Build main system:

cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/system/system-meta

LFSSetUp will have created a symlink to your desired init type so use:
./system-meta.LFSBuild install

Or if you have changed your mind you can install a different init system like so:

Use system-sysvinit-meta for standard sysvinit like so:
./system-sysvinit-meta.LFSBuild install

Or use system-bbinit-meta.LFSBuildfor a busy box init system ( non standard ) like so:
./system-bbinit-meta.LFSBuild install

Or for ##experimental## custom init system use:
./system-LFSInit-meta.LFSBuild install

Wait for script to complete ...
Have coffee
Walk the dog
...

logout from temporary system
exit

Remove the tools folder from your LFS install disk.
rm -rf /mnt/LFS/tools

Re-enter the chroot ( this time and subsequent times don't use the 'system' argument to Chroot ).
./Chroot

You ###MUST### rebuild lfspkg after completing the the basic system and removing the tools folder.
Use same process as before EXCEPT do NOT use BOOTSTRAP=1
If you have set any variable in /etc/lfspkg.rc then reply 'R' ( without the quotes ) when asked about replacing files in /etc.
If you forgot to do the above bit just re-edit /etc/lfspkg.rc:

cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/admin/LFSPkg
./LFSPkg.LFSBuild

Configure and build the kernel:
Some example configs are here ( on the CD NOT in the chroot ):
/usr/share/KernelConfigs
Suffix indicates 64/32 bit configs, thanks to Slackware for the huge configs.
So for instance to use one of these use ( from the host ):
cp /usr/share/KernelConfigs/VBOX-config-5.2.8_64 /mnt/LFS/LFSPkgBuildScripts/kernel/config-5.2.8
Replace config-5.2.8 with config-YOURKERNELVERSION if needed.

cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/kernel
./kernel.LFSBuild install

Install firmware (optional)
./firmware.LFSBuild install

Optional install of grub, see here:
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter08/grub.html

If your host already has grub installed you should configure that to boot your new LFS system, or manually do this:

assuming root device is /dev/sda and LFS system is on /dev/sda2 mounted at /mnt/LFS
grub-install /dev/sda

The LFSSetup script will install a basic grub.cfg file in /mnt/LFS/${BUILDSCRIPTS}/system/grub/ based on the details given to the script.
Check that the grub.cfg file is OK, make any changes and just copy it to /boot/grub like so ( whilst still in chroot ):
cp /LFSPkgBuildScripts/system/grub/grub.cfg /boot/grub

Or get the system variables set previously:
. /LFSScripts/SystemData.local

cat > /boot/grub/grub.cfg << EOF
# Begin /boot/grub/grub.cfg
set default=0
set timeout=30

insmod ext2
set root=(hd0,2)

menuentry "GNU/Linux, Linux $KERNELVERSION LFS $LFSVERSION" {
	gfxpayload=1024x768x32,1024x768
	linux /boot/vmlinuz-$KERNELVERSION root=$ROOTDEV ro
}
EOF

Install GPM service
cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/HelperScripts
./InstallServices
If dialog has not been installed you will need to install sevices manually
cd blfs-bootscripts-20190609
make install-gpm

Exit from chroot and reboot to your new LFS system to check that all is well, don't forget to eject the CD:
exit
Don't forget to eject the CD.
eject /dev/cdrom

reboot

You may now add extra packages from the LFSPkgBuildScripts see the HowTo in the /LFSScripts folder on instructions to build a complete desktop, what you add now is up to you good luck!
If you are running on vbox and want to install the quest additions you may need to install which ( cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/sys/which/;./which.LFSBuild install ).
