Live CD based heavily on this:
https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/~purschke/RescueCD/
Thanks!

The system (/) is in a RAM disk, for this help it is assumed the cd will be mounted on /cdrom and the partition for the new LFS system is /dev/sda1, alter as needed.
The cdrom data may or may not be mounted, so if /cdrom is empty/not a mountpoint then you need to mount the cd manually eg:

mount /dev/sr0 /cdrom

Use fdisk to create a partition table, a partition for LFS etc if needed on the hard drive, WARNING if your hard drive has already has a partition table be careful not to create a new one as it will delete all partitions on the drive , BACKUP YOUR DATA!!!!

fdisk /dev/sda
...
Create partition table etc
...

Format partition for new install of LFS if needed, eg:

mke2fs -L MyNewLFS /dev/sda1

Create a suitable mount point ( /mnt/LFS should already exist unless something went wrong ), mount the partition, and cd into it, eg:

mkdir -vp /mnt/LFS
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/LFS
cd /mnt/LFS

Run the setup script to copy needed files etc, mostly you can just hit enter to accept the defaults, but you will probably have to change the gateway IP, enter y at the end to complete the transfer:

LFSSetUp

Change to the LFSScripts folder:
cd /mnt/LFS/LFSScripts

Run Build File System script:
./BuildFileSystem

Chroot into temporary system:
./Chroot system

You should now be in the chroot.
First install lfspkg:
cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/admin/LFSPkg
BOOTSTRAP=1 ./LFSPkg.LFSBuild install

As part of the LFSSetUp script /root/.lfspkg.rc has been created to contain basic info needed by lfspkg, review and change if needed.
#Set $LFS/etc/lfspkg.rc or $LFS/root/.lfspkg.rc (preferred) variables, make sure the SOURCEARCHIVES points to the same place as $SOURCEARCHIVES from SystemData.local as that's where the main LFS system source files are, you can do this either from in the chroot environment or from the host with root permissions.

Build main system
cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/system/system-meta
Use system-sysvinit-meta for standard sysvinit like so:
./system-sysvinit-meta.LFSBuild install

Or use system-bbinit-meta.LFSBuildfor a RECOMMENDED busy box init system ( non standard ) like so:
./system-bbinit-meta.LFSBuild install

Or for ##experimental## custom init system use:
./system-LFSInit-meta.LFSBuild install


Wait for script to complete ...
Have coffee
Walkt the dog
...

logout from temporary system
exit

Remove the tools folder from your LFS install disk.
sudo rm -rf ${LFS}/tools

Re-enter the chroot ( this time and subsequent times don't use the 'system' argument to Chroot ).
sudo ./Chroot

You MUST rebuild lfspkg after completing the the basic system and removing the tools folder.
Use same process as before EXCEPT do NOT use BOOTSTRAP=1
If you have set any variable in /etc/lfspkg.rc then reply 'R' ( without the quotes ) when asked about replacing files in /etc.
If you forgot to do the above bit just re-edit /etc/lfspkg.rc:

cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/admin/LFSPkg
./LFSPkg.LFSBuild install

Configure and build the kernel:
cd /LFSPkgBuildScripts/kernel
./kernel.LFSBuild install


Optional install of grub, see here:
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter08/grub.html

The LFSSetup script will install a basic grub.cfg file in ${LFS}/${BUILDSCRIPTS}/system/grub/ based on the details given to the script.
Check that the grub.cfg file is OK, make any changes and just copy it to /boot/grub, or manually do this:

assuming root device is /dev/sda and LFS system is on /dev/sda1 mounted at /mnt/LFS
grub-install /dev/sda

cat > /boot/grub/grub.cfg << "EOF"
# Begin /boot/grub/grub.cfg
set default=0
set timeout=30

insmod ext2
set root=(hd0,1)

menuentry "GNU/Linux, Linux 4.9.9-lfs-8.0" {
	linux /boot/vmlinuz-4.9.9-lfs-8.0 root=/dev/sda1 ro
}
EOF

Exit fro chroot and reboot to your new LFS system to check that all is well, don't forget to eject the CD:
exit
reboot

You may now add extra packages from the LFSPkgBuildScripts see the HowTo in the /LFSScripts folder on instructions to build a complete desktop, what you add now is up to you good luck!
