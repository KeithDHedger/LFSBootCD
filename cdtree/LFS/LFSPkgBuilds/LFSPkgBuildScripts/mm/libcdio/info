http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/multimedia/libcdio.html The libcdio is a library for CD-ROM and CD image access. The associated libcdio-cdparanoia library reads audio from the CD-ROM directly as data, with no analog step between, and writes the data to a file or pipe as .wav, .aifc or as raw 16 bit linear PCM.
