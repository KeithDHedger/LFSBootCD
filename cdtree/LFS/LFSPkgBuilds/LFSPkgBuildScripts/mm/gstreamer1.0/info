GStreamer is a streaming media framework that enables applications to share a common set of plugins for things like video encoding and decoding, audio encoding and decoding, audio and video filters, audio visualisation, web streaming and anything else that streams in real-time or otherwise.
This package only provides base functionality and libraries.
You may need at least gst-plugins-base-1.4.5 and one of Good, Bad, Ugly or Libav plugins.
