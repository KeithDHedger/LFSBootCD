The GStreamer Bad Plug-ins package contains a set a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared to the rest.
They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.
Also see the gst-plugins-good-0.10.31, gst-plugins-ugly-0.10.19 and gst-ffmpeg-0.10.13 packages.
