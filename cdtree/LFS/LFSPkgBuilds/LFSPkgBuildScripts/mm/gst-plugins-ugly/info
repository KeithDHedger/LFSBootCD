The GStreamer Ugly Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins considered by the GStreamer developers to have good quality and correct functionality, but distributing them might pose problems.
The license on either the plug-ins or the supporting libraries might not be how the GStreamer developers would like.
The code might be widely known to present patent problems.
