The libmpeg2 package contains a library for decoding MPEG-2 and MPEG-1 video streams.
The library is able to decode all MPEG streams that conform to certain restrictions: &ldquo;constrained parameters&rdquo; for MPEG-1, and &ldquo;main profile&rdquo; for MPEG-2.
This is useful for programs and applications needing to decode MPEG-2 and MPEG-1 video streams.
