libconfig (Library for processing structured configuration files)
Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration
files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML
and unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
parsing in application code. It is very compact and well-suited for
memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.
The library includes bindings for both the C and C++ languages.
