libjpeg-turbo (accelerated libjpeg)
libjpeg-turbo is a version of libjpeg which uses MMX, SSE, and SSE2
SIMD instructions to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and
decompression by about 2-4x on x86 and x86-64 platforms. It is based
on libjpeg/SIMD but has numerous enhancements.
See README-turbo.txt in /usr/doc/libjpeg-turbo* for usage hints.
