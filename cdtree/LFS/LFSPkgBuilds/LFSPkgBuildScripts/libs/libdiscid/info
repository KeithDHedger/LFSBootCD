The libdiscid package contains a library for creating MusicBrainz DiscIDs from audio CDs.
It reads a CD's table of contents (TOC) and generates an identifier which can be used to lookup the CD at MusicBrainz (http://musicbrainz.org).
Additionally, it provides a submission URL for adding the DiscID to the database.
