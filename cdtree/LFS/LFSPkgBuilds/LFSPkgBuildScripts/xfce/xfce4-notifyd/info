The Xfce4 Notification Daemon is a small program that implements the "server-side" portion of the Freedesktop desktop notifications specification.
Applications that wish to pop up a notification bubble in a standard way can use Xfce4-Notifyd to do so by sending standard messages over D-Bus using the org.freedesktop.Notifications interface.
