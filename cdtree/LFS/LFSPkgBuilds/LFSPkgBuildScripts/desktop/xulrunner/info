xulrunner (XULRunner provides the XUL Runtime environment)
The XULRunner project is a Mozilla runtime package that can be used
to bootstrap XUL+XPCOM applications that are as rich as Thunderbird
and Firefox. It will provide mechanisms for installing, upgrading,
and uninstalling these applications. XULRunner will also provide
libxul, a solution which allows the embedding of Mozilla technologies
in other projects and products.
