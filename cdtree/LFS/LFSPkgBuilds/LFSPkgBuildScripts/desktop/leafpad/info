leafpad (a notepad clone for GTK+ 2.0)
Leafpad is a simple GTK+ text editor that emphasizes simplicity.
As development focuses on keeping weight down to a minimum,
only the most essential features are implemented in the editor.
Leafpad is simple to use, it's easily compiled, requires few
libraries, and starts up quickly.
