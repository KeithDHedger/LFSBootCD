Xarchiver (A GTK+2 only Archive Manager)
Xarchiver is a Desktop Environment independent archiver frontend.
All common archive types are supported. RPM and DEB packages are
handled without their package managers. To run it you only need
GTK+2 libraries and obviously the various rar, arj and 7z for
these archive types.
