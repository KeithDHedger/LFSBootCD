cairo-dock (a light and eye-candy dock)
Cairo-Dock is a unified interface to your desktop : it provides a
dock, a taskbar, and many applets that can be placed either inside
the dock or on your desktop, at your convenience! It uses
Cairo/OpenGL to render nice graphics with hardware acceleration,
which makes it very smooth and low on CPU. It's highly customisable
and comes with a lot of ready-to-use themes.
