comix (Viewer for archived images)
Cartoons are, most of the time, archived.
comix opens an archive file and displays images in it, removing
the need to decompress comicbook files.
It reads images in zip, rar, or tar(gzip or bzip2) archives.
It is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings.
