udevil (removable devices manager)
udevil is a command line Linux program which mounts and unmounts
removable devices without a password, shows device info, and monitors
device changes. It can also mount ISO files, nfs://, smb://, ftp://,
ssh:// URLs, and tmpfs/ramfs filesystems.
udevil is highly configurable, requires no daemon running, and depends
only on udev and glib. To use it, just prefix a normal mount command
with 'udevil'.
