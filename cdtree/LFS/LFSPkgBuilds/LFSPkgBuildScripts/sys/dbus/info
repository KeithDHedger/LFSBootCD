D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another.
D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as &ldquo;new hardware device added&rdquo; or &ldquo;printer queue changed&rdquo;) and a per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications).
Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two applications to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon).
