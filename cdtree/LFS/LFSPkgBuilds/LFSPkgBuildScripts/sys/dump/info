dump (dump and restore backup commands)
Dump examines files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be
backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
storage medium. Subsequent incremental backups can then be layered on top
of the full backup.
The restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore
a full backup of a filesystem. Single files and directory subtrees may
also be restored from full or partial backups in interractive mode.
