Shadow was indeed installed in LFS and there is no reason to reinstall it unless you installed CrackLib or Linux-PAM after your LFS system was completed.
If you have installed CrackLib after LFS, then reinstalling Shadow will enable strong password support.
If you have installed Linux-PAM, reinstalling Shadow will allow programs such as login and su to utilize PAM.
