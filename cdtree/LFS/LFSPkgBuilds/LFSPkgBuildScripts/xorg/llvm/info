The LLVM package contains a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.
The Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) Core libraries provide a modern source and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!).
These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").
