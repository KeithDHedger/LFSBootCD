libvdpau (VDPAU wrapper library)
This package contains the libvdpau wrapper library and the
libvdpau_trace debugging library, along with the header files needed
to build VDPAU applications. To actually use a VDPAU device, you
need a vendor-specific implementation library, like the one
shipped with nvidia's binary graphics driver.
