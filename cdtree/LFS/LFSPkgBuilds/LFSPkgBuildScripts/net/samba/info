The Samba package provides file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients and Windows networking to Linux clients.
Samba can also be configured as a Windows Domain Controller replacement, a file/print server acting as a member of a Windows Active Directory domain and a NetBIOS (rfc1001/1002) nameserver (which among other things provides LAN browsing support).
