The Network Security Services (NSS) package is a set of libraries designed to support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications.
Applications built with NSS can support SSL v2 and v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other security standards.
This is useful for implementing SSL and S/MIME or other Internet security standards into an application.
