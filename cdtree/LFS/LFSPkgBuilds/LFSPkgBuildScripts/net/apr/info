The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) is a supporting library for the Apache web server.
It provides a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that map to the underlying Operating System (OS).
Where the OS doesn't support a particular function, APR will provide an emulation.
Thus programmers can use the APR to make a program portable across different platforms.
