davfs2 (virtual filesystem driver for WebDAV)
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the
HTTP-protocol, allows authoring of resources on a remote web server.
davfs2 provides the ability to access such resources like a typical
filesystem, allowing for use by standard applications with no built-in
support for WebDAV.
