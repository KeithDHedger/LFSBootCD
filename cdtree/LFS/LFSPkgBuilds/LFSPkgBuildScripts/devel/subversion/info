Subversion is a version control system that is designed to be a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community.
It extends and enhances CVS' feature set, while maintaining a similar interface for those already familiar with CVS.
These instructions install the client and server software used to manipulate a Subversion repository.
Creation of a repository is covered at Running a Subversion Server.
