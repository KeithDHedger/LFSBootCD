Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending applications.
It is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language.
Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms.
The implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost.
The result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal in embedded systems too.
