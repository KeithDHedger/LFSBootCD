XForms (X11 graphical user interface toolkit)
XForms is a graphical user interface toolkit based on the X11 Xlib
library.  It comes with a lot of widgets (buttons, menus, input fields
scrollbars, you name it) as well as fdesign, a tool that lets you
create a GUI using a GUI.  In addition, the library is extensible and
new objects can easily be created and added to the library.
