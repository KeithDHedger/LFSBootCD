tcc (Tiny C Compiler) Tiny C Compiler is a very fast C compiler. Unlike other C compilers, it is meant to be self-relying: you do not need an external assembler or linker because TCC does that for you. TCC supports ANSI C and most of ISO C99 and many GNUC extensions, including inline assembly. tcc was written by Fabrice Bellard and is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
