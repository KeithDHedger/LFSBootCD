The Apache Ant package is a Java-based build tool.
In theory, it is kind of like make, but without make's wrinkles.
Ant is different.
Instead of a model that is extended with shell-based commands, Ant is extended using Java classes.
Instead of writing shell commands, the configuration files are XML-based, calling out a target tree that executes various tasks.
Each task is run by an object that implements a particular task interface.
