ddd (Data Display Debugger)
GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as
GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash
debugger, or the Python debugger. Besides "usual" front-end features
such as viewing source texts, DDD has become famous through its
interactive graphical data display, where data structures are
displayed as graphs.
