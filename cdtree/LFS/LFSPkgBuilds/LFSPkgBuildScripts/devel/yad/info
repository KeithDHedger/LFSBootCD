yad (displays graphical dialogs from shell scripts or command line)
Yad (yet another dialog) is a fork of Zenity with many improvements,
including custom buttons, additional dialogs and a pop-up menu in
the notification area.
There were two main reasons for this fork.  The first was to remove
dependencies on deprecated libraries like libglade and gnome-canvas.
The second was the slow pace of Zenity development including many
unimplemented enhancement suggestions in the GNOME Bugzilla.
