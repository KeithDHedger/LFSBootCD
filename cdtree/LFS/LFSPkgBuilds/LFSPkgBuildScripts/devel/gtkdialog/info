gtkdialog (GTK2 UI builder)
Gtkdialog is a small utility for fast and easy GUI building. It
can be used to create dialog boxes for almost any interpreted and
compiled programs which is a very attractive feature since the
developer does not have to learn various GUI languages for the
miscellaneous programming languages.
