devhelp (an API documentation browser for GTK+ and GNOME)
Devhelp is an API documentation browser for GTK+ and GNOME.  It works
natively with gtk-doc (the API reference framework developed for GTK+
and used throughout GNOME for API documentation). If you use gtk-doc
with your project, you can use Devhelp to browse the documentation.
