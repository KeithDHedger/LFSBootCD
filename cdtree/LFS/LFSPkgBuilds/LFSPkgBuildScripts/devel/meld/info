meld (a visual diff and merge tool)
Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. You can compare two or three
files and edit them in place (diffs update dynamically). You can
compare two or three folders and launch file comparisons. You can
browse and view a working copy from popular version control systems
such as CVS, Subversion, Bazaar-ng and Mercurial. Look at the
screenshots page for more detailed features.
