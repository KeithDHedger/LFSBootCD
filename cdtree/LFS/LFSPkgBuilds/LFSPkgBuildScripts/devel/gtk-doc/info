The GTK-Doc package contains a code documenter.
This is useful for extracting specially formatted comments from the code to create API documentation.
This package is optional; if it is not installed, packages will not build the documentation.
This does not mean that you will not have any documentation.
If GTK-Doc is not available, the install process will copy any pre-built documentation to your system.
