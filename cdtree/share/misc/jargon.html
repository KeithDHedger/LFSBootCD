<pre>#======= THIS IS THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 4.3.1, 29 JUN 2001 =======#
</pre>

<p>This is the Jargon File, a comprehensive compendium of hacker slang
illuminating many aspects of hackish tradition, folklore, and humor.

<p>This document (the Jargon File) is in the public domain, to be freely
used, shared, and modified.  There are (by intention) no legal
restraints on what you can do with it, but there are traditions about
its proper use to which many hackers are quite strongly attached. 
Please extend the courtesy of proper citation when you quote the File,
ideally with a version number, as it will change and grow over time. 
(Examples of appropriate citation form: "Jargon File 4.3.1" or
"The on-line hacker Jargon File, version 4.3.1, 29 JUN 2001".)

<p>The Jargon File is a common heritage of the hacker culture. 
Over the years a number of individuals have volunteered considerable
time to maintaining the File and been recognized by the net at large
as editors of it.  Editorial responsibilities include: to collate
contributions and suggestions from others; to seek out corroborating
information; to cross-reference related entries; to keep the file in a
consistent format; and to announce and distribute updated versions
periodically.  Current volunteer editors include:

<p>	Eric Raymond 	<a href="mailto:esr@snark.thyrsus.com">esr@snark.thyrsus.com</a>

<p>Although there is no requirement that you do so, it is considered good
form to check with an editor before quoting the File in a published work
or commercial product.  We may have additional information that would be
helpful to you and can assist you in framing your quote to reflect
not only the letter of the File but its spirit as well.

<p>All contributions and suggestions about this file sent to a volunteer
editor are gratefully received and will be regarded, unless otherwise
labelled, as freely given donations for possible use as part of this
public-domain file.

<p>From time to time a snapshot of this file has been polished, edited,
and formatted for commercial publication with the cooperation of the
volunteer editors and the hacker community at large.  If you wish to
have a bound paper copy of this file, you may find it convenient to
purchase one of these.  They often contain additional material not
found in on-line versions.  The two `authorized' editions so far are
described in the Revision History section; there may be more in the
future.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This document is a collection of slang terms used by various
subcultures of computer hackers.  Though some technical material is
included for background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary;
what we describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for
fun, social communication, and technical debate.

<p>The `hacker culture' is actually a loosely networked collection of
subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared
experiences, shared roots, and shared values.  It has its own myths,
heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams.  Because
hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define
themselves partly by rejection of `normal' values and working habits,
it has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional
culture less than 40 years old.

<p>As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold
their culture together -- it helps hackers recognize each other's
places in the community and expresses shared values and experiences. 
Also as usual, <em>not</em> knowing the slang (or using it
inappropriately) defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of
all in hackish vocabulary) possibly even a <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>.  All human
cultures use slang in this threefold way -- as a tool of
communication, and of inclusion, and of exclusion.

<p>Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps
in the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard
to detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are
code for shared states of <em>consciousness</em>.  There is a whole
range of altered states and problem-solving mental stances basic to
high-level hacking which don't fit into conventional linguistic
reality any better than a Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's
`trompe l'oeil' compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and
hacker slang encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways.  As a
simple example, take the distinction between a <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b> and an
<b><a href="#elegant">elegant</a></b> solution, and the differing connotations attached to each. 
The distinction is not only of engineering significance; it reaches
right back into the nature of the generative processes in program
design and asserts something important about two different kinds of
relationship between the hacker and the hack.  Hacker slang is
unusually rich in implications of this kind, of overtones and
undertones that illuminate the hackish psyche.

<p>But there is more.  Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very
conscious and inventive in their use of language.  These traits seem
to be common in young children, but the conformity-enforcing machine
we are pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of
most of us before adolescence.  Thus, linguistic invention in most
subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious
process.  Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a
game to be played for conscious pleasure.  Their inventions thus
display an almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of
language-play with the discrimination of educated and powerful
intelligence.  Further, the electronic media which knit them together
are fluid, `hot' connections, well adapted to both the dissemination
of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and superannuated
specimens.  The results of this process give us perhaps a uniquely
intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action.

<p>Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and
anthropological assumptions.  For example, it has recently become
fashionable to speak of `low-context' versus `high-context'
communication, and to classify cultures by the preferred context level
of their languages and art forms.  It is usually claimed that
low-context communication (characterized by precision, clarity, and
completeness of self-contained utterances) is typical in cultures
which value logic, objectivity, individualism, and competition; by
contrast, high-context communication (elliptical, emotive,
nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is associated with cultures
which value subjectivity, consensus, cooperation, and tradition.  What
then are we to make of hackerdom, which is themed around extremely
low-context interaction with computers and exhibits primarily
"low-context" values, but cultivates an almost absurdly high-context
slang style?

<p>The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a
compilation of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the
surrounding culture -- and, in fact, this one is the latest version
of an evolving compilation called the `Jargon File', maintained by
hackers themselves since the early 1970s.  This one (like its ancestors)
is primarily a lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect
background or sidelight information on hacker culture that would be
awkward to try to subsume under individual slang definitions.

<p>Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that
the material be enjoyable to browse.  Even a complete outsider should
find at least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is
amusingly thought-provoking.  But it is also true that hackers use
humorous wordplay to make strong, sometimes combative statements
about what they feel.  Some of these entries reflect the views of
opposing sides in disputes that have been genuinely passionate; this
is deliberate.  We have not tried to moderate or pretty up these
disputes; rather we have attempted to ensure that <em>everyone's</em>
sacred cows get gored, impartially.  Compromise is not particularly a
hackish virtue, but the honest presentation of divergent viewpoints
is.

<p>The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references
incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them.  We have not felt
it either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,
contribute flavor, and one of this document's major intended audiences
-- fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture -- will benefit
from them.

<p>A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included
in <b><a href="#Appendix%20A">Appendix A</a></b>. The `outside' reader's attention is particularly
directed to the Portrait of J. Random Hacker in <b><a href="#Appendix%20B">Appendix B</a></b>. 
Appendix C, the <b><a href="#Bibliography">Bibliography</a></b>, lists some non-technical works
which have either influenced or described the hacker culture.

<p>Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must
choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line
between description and influence can become more than a little
blurred.  Earlier versions of the Jargon File have played a central
role in spreading hacker language and the culture that goes with it to
successively larger populations, and we hope and expect that this one
will do likewise.

<h2>Of Slang, Jargon, and Techspeak</h2>

<p>Linguists usually refer to informal language as `slang' and reserve
the term `jargon' for the technical vocabularies of various
occupations.  However, the ancestor of this collection was called the
`Jargon File', and hacker slang is traditionally `the jargon'.  When
talking about the jargon there is therefore no convenient way to
distinguish it from what a <em>linguist</em> would call hackers' jargon
-- the formal vocabulary they learn from textbooks, technical papers,
and manuals.

<p>To make a confused situation worse, the line between hacker slang and
the vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy,
and shifts over time.  Further, this vocabulary is shared with a wider
technical culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do
not speak or recognize hackish slang.

<p>Accordingly, this lexicon will try to be as precise as the facts of
usage permit about the distinctions among three categories:

<ul>
<li>`slang': informal language from mainstream English or non-technical
subcultures (bikers, rock fans, surfers, etc).

<li>`jargon': without qualifier, denotes informal `slangy' language
peculiar to or predominantly found among hackers -- the subject of
this lexicon.

<li>`techspeak': the formal technical vocabulary of programming, computer
science, electronics, and other fields connected to hacking. 
</ul>

<p>This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder of
this lexicon.

<p>The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one.  A lot of
techspeak originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing
uptake of jargon into techspeak.  On the other hand, a lot of jargon
arises from overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about
this in the <b><a href="#Jargon%20Construction">Jargon Construction</a></b> section below).

<p>In general, we have considered techspeak any term that communicates
primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks, technical
dictionaries, or standards documents.

<p>A few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems, languages,
or documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker folklore that
isn't covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey critical
historical background necessary to understand other entries to which
they are cross-referenced.  Some other techspeak senses of jargon
words are listed in order to make the jargon senses clear; where
the text does not specify that a straight technical sense is under
discussion, these are marked with `[techspeak]' as an etymology.  Some
entries have a primary sense marked this way, with subsequent jargon
meanings explained in terms of it.

<p>We have also tried to indicate (where known) the apparent origins of
terms.  The results are probably the least reliable information in the
lexicon, for several reasons.  For one thing, it is well known that
many hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple
times, even among the more obscure and intricate neologisms.  It often
seems that the generative processes underlying hackish jargon
formation have an internal logic so powerful as to create substantial
parallelism across separate cultures and even in different languages! 
For another, the networks tend to propagate innovations so quickly
that `first use' is often impossible to pin down.  And, finally,
compendia like this one alter what they observe by implicitly stamping
cultural approval on terms and widening their use.

<p>Despite these problems, the organized collection of jargon-related
oral history for the new compilations has enabled us to put to rest
quite a number of folk etymologies, place credit where credit is due,
and illuminate the early history of many important hackerisms such as
<b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b>, <b><a href="#cruft">cruft</a></b>, and <b><a href="#foo">foo</a></b>.  We believe specialist
lexicographers will find many of the historical notes more than
casually instructive.

<h2>Revision History</h2>

<p>The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from
technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab
(SAIL), and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities
including Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University
(CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

<p>The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as `jargon-1' or `the File')
was begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975.  From this time until
the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the File was
named AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] there.  Some terms in it date back
considerably earlier (<b><a href="#frob">frob</a></b> and some senses of <b><a href="#moby">moby</a></b>, for
instance, go back to the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and are
believed to date at least back to the early 1960s).  The revisions of
jargon-1 were all unnumbered and may be collectively considered
`Version 1'.

<p>In 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on
the SAIL computer, <b><a href="#FTP">FTP</a></b>ed a copy of the File to MIT.  He noticed that
it was hardly restricted to `AI words' and so stored the file on
his directory as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON.

<p>The file was quickly renamed JARGON &gt; (the `&gt;' caused versioning under
ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin and Guy L. 
Steele Jr.  Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody thought of
correcting the term `jargon' to `slang' until the compendium had
already become widely known as the Jargon File.

<p>Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter
and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was
subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic
resynchronizations).

<p>The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard
Stallman was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and
ITS-related coinages.

<p>In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of
the File published in Stewart Brand's "CoEvolution Quarterly"
(issue 29, pages 26-35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy
Steele (including a couple of the Crunchly cartoons).  This appears to
have been the File's first paper publication.

<p>A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass
market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as
"The Hacker's Dictionary" (Harper &amp; Row CN 1082, ISBN
0-06-091082-8).  The other jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don
Woods, and Mark Crispin) contributed to this revision, as did Richard
M. Stallman and Geoff Goodfellow.  This book (now out of print) is
hereafter referred to as `Steele-1983' and those six as the
Steele-1983 coauthors.

<p>Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively
stopped growing and changing.  Originally, this was due to a desire to
freeze the file temporarily to facilitate the production of
Steele-1983, but external conditions caused the `temporary' freeze
to become permanent.

<p>The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding
cuts and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported
hardware and software instead of homebrew whenever possible.  At MIT,
most AI work had turned to dedicated LISP Machines.  At the same time,
the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best
and brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in
Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley.  The startups built LISP
machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a <b><a href="#TWENEX">TWENEX</a></b>
system rather than a host for the AI hackers' beloved <b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b>.

<p>The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although
the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource
until 1991.  Stanford became a major <b><a href="#TWENEX">TWENEX</a></b> site, at one point
operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the mid-1980s
most of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging
BSD Unix standard.

<p>In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the
File were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter
project at Digital Equipment Corporation.  The File's compilers,
already dispersed, moved on to other things.  Steele-1983 was partly a
monument to what its authors thought was a dying tradition; no one
involved realized at the time just how wide its influence was to
be.

<p>By the mid-1980s the File's content was dated, but the legend that had
grown up around it never quite died out.  The book, and softcopies
obtained off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures far removed from
MIT and Stanford; the content exerted a strong and continuing
influence on hacker language and humor.  Even as the advent of the
microcomputer and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of
hackerdom, the File (and related materials such as the <b><a href="#Some%20AI%20Koans">Some AI Koans</a></b> in
Appendix A) came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture
Matter of Britain chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of
the Lab.  The pace of change in hackerdom at large accelerated
tremendously -- but the Jargon File, having passed from living
document to icon, remained essentially untouched for seven years.

<p>This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of
jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after
careful consultation with the editors of Steele-1983).  It merges in
about 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and
a very few entries introduced in Steele-1983 that are now also
obsolete.

<p>This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim
is to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all the technical
computing cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested.  More
than half of the entries now derive from <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b> and represent jargon
now current in the C and Unix communities, but special efforts have
been made to collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC
programmers, Amiga fans, Mac enthusiasts, and even the IBM mainframe
world.

revisions by ESR (Eric S. Raymond) with assistance from GLS (Guy L. 
Steele, Jr.) leading up to and including the second paper edition. 
From now on, major version number N.00 will probably correspond to the
Nth paper edition.  Usually later versions will either completely
supersede or incorporate earlier versions, so there is generally no
point in keeping old versions around.

<h1>How Jargon Works</h1>

<h2>Jargon Construction</h2>

<p>There are some standard methods of jargonification that became
established quite early (i.e., before 1970), spreading from such
sources as the Tech Model Railroad Club, the PDP-1 SPACEWAR hackers,
and John McCarthy's original crew of LISPers.  These include verb
doubling, soundalike slang, the `-P' convention, overgeneralization,
spoken inarticulations, and anthropomorphization.  Each is discussed
below.  We also cover the standard comparatives for design quality.

<p>Of these six, verb doubling, overgeneralization, anthropomorphization,
and (especially) spoken inarticulations have become quite general; but
soundalike slang is still largely confined to MIT and other large
universities, and the `-P' convention is found only where LISPers
flourish.

<h3>Verb Doubling</h3>

<p>A standard construction in English is to double a verb
and use it as an exclamation, such as "Bang, bang!" or "Quack,
quack!".  Most of these are names for noises.  Hackers also double
verbs as a concise, sometimes sarcastic comment on what the implied
subject does.  Also, a doubled verb is often used to terminate a
conversation, in the process remarking on the current state of affairs
or what the speaker intends to do next.  Typical examples involve
<b><a href="#win">win</a></b>, <b><a href="#lose">lose</a></b>, <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b>, <b><a href="#flame">flame</a></b>, <b><a href="#barf">barf</a></b>, <b><a href="#chomp">chomp</a></b>:

<blockquote>
"The disk heads just crashed."  "Lose, lose."<br>
"Mostly he talked about his latest crock.  Flame, flame."<br>
"Boy, what a bagbiter!  Chomp, chomp!" 
</blockquote>

<p>Some verb-doubled constructions have special meanings not immediately
obvious from the verb.  These have their own listings in the lexicon.

<p>The <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b> culture has one <em>tripling</em> convention unrelated to
this; the names of `joke' topic groups often have a tripled last
element.  The first and paradigmatic example was
<i>alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</i> (a "Muppet Show" reference);
other infamous examples have included:

<blockquote>
<i>alt.french.captain.borg.borg.borg</i><br>
<i>alt.wesley.crusher.die.die.die</i><br>
<i>comp.unix.internals.system.calls.brk.brk.brk</i><br>
<i>sci.physics.edward.teller.boom.boom.boom</i><br>
<i>alt.sadistic.dentists.drill.drill.drill</i>
</blockquote>

<p>These two traditions fuse in the newsgroup
<i>alt.adjective.noun.verb.verb.verb</i>, devoted to humor based on
deliberately confounding parts of speech.  Several observers have noted
that the contents of this group is excellently representative of the
peculiarities of hacker humor.

<br>

<h3>Soundalike slang</h3>

<p>Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to
convert an ordinary word or phrase into something more interesting. 
It is considered particularly <b><a href="#flavorful">flavorful</a></b> if the phrase is bent so
as to include some other jargon word; thus the computer hobbyist
magazine "Dr. Dobb's Journal" is almost always referred to among
hackers as `Dr. Frob's Journal' or simply `Dr. Frob's'.  Terms of
this kind that have been in fairly wide use include names for
newspapers:

<pre>    Boston Herald =&gt; Horrid (or Harried)
    Boston Globe =&gt; Boston Glob
    Houston (or San Francisco) Chronicle
           =&gt; the Crocknicle (or the Comical)
    New York Times =&gt; New York Slime
    Wall Street Journal =&gt; Wall Street Urinal
</pre>

<p>However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment. 
Standard examples include:

<pre>    Data General =&gt; Dirty Genitals
    IBM 360 =&gt; IBM Three-Sickly
    Government Property --- Do Not Duplicate (on keys)
            =&gt; Government Duplicity --- Do Not Propagate
    for historical reasons =&gt; for hysterical raisins
    Margaret Jacks Hall (the CS building at Stanford)
            =&gt; Marginal Hacks Hall
    Microsoft =&gt; Microsloth
    Internet Explorer =&gt; Internet Exploiter
</pre>

<p>This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been
compared to in the past, because Cockney substitutions are opaque
whereas hacker punning jargon is intentionally transparent.

<h3>The `-P' convention</h3>

<p>Turning a word into a question by appending the
syllable `P'; from the LISP convention of appending the letter `P'
to denote a predicate (a boolean-valued function).  The question
should expect a yes/no answer, though it needn't.  (See <b><a href="#T">T</a></b> and <b><a href="#NIL">NIL</a></b>.)

<pre>    At dinnertime:<br>
          Q: ``Foodp?''<br>
          A: ``Yeah, I'm pretty hungry.'' or ``T!''<br>

    At any time:<br>
          Q: ``State-of-the-world-P?''<br>
          A: (Straight) ``I'm about to go home.''<br>
          A: (Humorous) ``Yes, the world has a state.''<br>

    On the phone to Florida:<br>
          Q: ``State-p Florida?''<br>
          A: ``Been reading JARGON.TXT again, eh?''
</pre>

<p>[One of the best of these is a <b><a href="#Gosperism">Gosperism</a></b>.  Once, when we were at a
Chinese restaurant, Bill Gosper wanted to know whether someone would
like to share with him a two-person-sized bowl of soup.  His inquiry

<h3>Overgeneralization</h3>

<p>A very conspicuous feature of jargon is the frequency with which
techspeak items such as names of program tools, command language
primitives, and even assembler opcodes are applied to contexts outside
of computing wherever hackers find amusing analogies to them.  Thus
(to cite one of the best-known examples) Unix hackers often <b><a href="#grep">grep</a></b>
for things rather than searching for them.  Many of the lexicon
entries are generalizations of exactly this kind.

<p>Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well. 
Many hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to
them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to
nonuniform cases (or vice versa).  For example, because

<blockquote>
porous =&gt; porosity<br>
generous =&gt; generosity
</blockquote>

<p>hackers happily generalize:

<blockquote>
mysterious =&gt; mysteriosity<br>
ferrous =&gt; ferrosity<br>
obvious =&gt; obviosity<br>
dubious =&gt; dubiosity
</blockquote>

<p>Another class of common construction uses the suffix `-itude' to
abstract a quality from just about any adjective or noun.  This usage
arises especially in cases where mainstream English would perform the
same abstraction through `-iness' or `-ingness'.  Thus:

<blockquote>
win =&gt; winnitude (a common exclamation)<br>
loss =&gt; lossitude<br>
cruft =&gt; cruftitude<br>
lame =&gt; lameitude
</blockquote>

<p>Some hackers cheerfully reverse this transformation; they argue, for
example, that the horizontal degree lines on a globe ought to be
called `lats' -- after all, they're measuring latitude!

<p>Also, note that all nouns can be verbed.  E.g.: "All nouns can be
verbed", "I'll mouse it up", "Hang on while I clipboard it over",
"I'm grepping the files".  English as a whole is already heading in
this direction (towards pure-positional grammar like Chinese); hackers
are simply a bit ahead of the curve.

<p>The suffix "-full" can also be applied in generalized and fanciful
ways, as in "As soon as you have more than one cachefull of data, the
system starts thrashing," or "As soon as I have more than one
headfull of ideas, I start writing it all down." A common use is
"screenfull", meaning the amount of text that will fit on one
screen, usually in text mode where you have no choice as to character
size. Another common form is "bufferfull".

<p>However, hackers avoid the unimaginative verb-making techniques
characteristic of marketroids, bean-counters, and the Pentagon; a
hacker would never, for example, `productize', `prioritize', or
`securitize' things.  Hackers have a strong aversion to bureaucratic
bafflegab and regard those who use it with contempt.

<p>Similarly, all verbs can be nouned.  This is only a slight
overgeneralization in modern English; in hackish, however, it
is good form to mark them in some standard nonstandard way.  Thus:

<blockquote>
win =&gt; winnitude, winnage<br>
disgust =&gt; disgustitude<br>
hack =&gt; hackification
</blockquote>

<p>Further, note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural
forms.  Some of these go back quite a ways; the TMRC Dictionary
includes an entry which implies that the plural of `mouse' is
<b><a href="#meeces">meeces</a></b>, and notes that the defined plural of `caboose' is
`cabeese'.  This latter has apparently been standard (or at least a
standard joke) among railfans (railroad enthusiasts) for many
years.

<p>On a similarly Anglo-Saxon note, almost anything ending in `x' may
form plurals in `-xen' (see <b><a href="#VAXen">VAXen</a></b> and <b><a href="#boxen">boxen</a></b> in the main
text).  Even words ending in phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes
treated this way; e.g., `soxen' for a bunch of socks.  Other funny
plurals are the Hebrew-style `frobbotzim' for the plural of `frobbozz'
(see <b><a href="#frobnitz">frobnitz</a></b>) and `Unices' and `Twenices' (rather than `Unixes'
and `Twenexes'; see <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b>, <b><a href="#TWENEX">TWENEX</a></b> in main text).  But note
that `Twenexen' was never used, and `Unixen' was not sighted in the
wild until the year 2000, thirty years after it might logically have
come into use; it has been suggested that this is because `-ix' and
`-ex' are Latin singular endings that attract a Latinate plural. 
Finally, it has been suggested to general approval that the plural of
`mongoose' ought to be `polygoose'.

<p>The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is
generalization of an inflectional rule that in English is either
an import or a fossil (such as the Hebrew plural ending `-im', or the
Anglo-Saxon plural suffix `-en') to cases where it isn't normally
considered to apply.

<p>This is not `poor grammar', as hackers are generally quite well
aware of what they are doing when they distort the language.  It is
grammatical creativity, a form of playfulness.  It is done not to
impress but to amuse, and never at the expense of clarity.

<h3>Spoken inarticulations</h3>

<p>Words such as `mumble', `sigh', and `groan' are spoken in places where
their referent might more naturally be used.  It has been suggested
that this usage derives from the impossibility of representing such
noises on a comm link or in electronic mail, MUDs, and IRC channels
(interestingly, the same sorts of constructions have been showing up
with increasing frequency in comic strips).  Another expression
sometimes heard is "Complain!", meaning "I have a
complaint!"

<br>

<h3>Anthropomorphization</h3>

<p>Semantically, one rich source of jargon constructions is the hackish
tendency to anthropomorphize hardware and software.  English purists
and academic computer scientists frequently look down on others for
anthropomorphizing hardware and software, considering this sort of
behavior to be characteristic of naive misunderstanding. But most
hackers anthropomorphize freely, frequently describing program
behavior in terms of wants and desires.

<p>Thus it is common to hear hardware or software talked about as though
it has homunculi talking to each other inside it, with intentions and
desires.  Thus, one hears "The protocol handler got confused", or
that programs "are trying" to do things, or one may say of a routine
that "its goal in life is to X".  Or: "You can't run those two
cards on the same bus; they fight over interrupt 9."

<p>One even hears explanations like "<small>...</small> and its poor little brain
couldn't understand X, and it died."  Sometimes modelling things this
way actually seems to make them easier to understand, perhaps because
it's instinctively natural to think of anything with a really complex
behavioral repertoire as `like a person' rather than `like a thing'.

<p>At first glance, to anyone who understands how these programs actually
work, this seems like an absurdity.  As hackers are among the people
who know best how these phenomena work, it seems odd that they would
use language that seems to ascribe conciousness to them.  The
mind-set behind this tendency thus demands examination.

<p>The key to understanding this kind of usage is that it isn't done in a
naive way; hackers don't personalize their stuff in the sense of
feeling empathy with it, nor do they mystically believe that the
things they work on every day are `alive'.  To the contrary: hackers
who anthropomorphize are expressing not a vitalistic view of program
behavior but a mechanistic view of human behavior.

<p>Almost all hackers subscribe to the mechanistic, materialistic
ontology of science (this is in practice true even of most of the
minority with contrary religious theories).  In this view, people
are biological machines - consciousness is an interesting and
valuable epiphenomenon, but mind is implemented in machinery which
is not fundamentally different in information-processing capacity
from computers.

<p>Hackers tend to take this a step further and argue that the difference
between a substrate of CHON atoms and water and a substrate of silicon
and metal is a relatively unimportant one; what matters, what makes a
thing `alive', is information and richness of pattern. This is animism
from the flip side; it implies that humans and computers and dolphins
and rocks are all machines exhibiting a continuum of modes of
`consciousness' according to their information-processing capacity.

<p>Because hackers accept that a human machine can have intentions, it
is therefore easy for them to ascribe consciousness and intention to
complex patterned systems such as computers.  If consciousness is
mechanical, it is neither more or less absurd to say that "The
program wants to go into an infinite loop" than it is to say that "I
want to go eat some chocolate" - and even defensible to say that
"The stone, once dropped, wants to move towards the center of the
earth".

<p>This viewpoint has respectable company in academic philosophy.  Daniel
Dennett organizes explanations of behavior using three stances: the
"physical stance" (thing-to-be-explained as a physical object), the
"design stance" (thing-to-be-explained as an artifact), and the
"intentional stance" (thing-to-be-explained as an agent with desires
and intentions).  Which stances are appropriate is a matter not of
truth but of utility.  Hackers typically view simple programs from the
design stance, but more complex ones are often modelled using the
intentional stance.

<p>It has also been argued that the anthropomorphization of software and
hardware reflects a blurring of the boundary between the programmer
and his artifacts - the human qualities belong to the programmer and
the code merely expresses these qualities as his/her proxy.  On this view,
a hacker saying a piece of code 'got confused' is really saying that
<em>he</em> (or she) was confused about exactly what he wanted the
computer to do, the code naturally incorporated this confusion, and
the code expressed the programmer's confusion when executed by
crashing or otherwise misbehaving.

<p>Note that by displacing from "I got confused" to "It got confused",
the programmer is not avoiding responsibility, but rather getting some
analytical distance in order to be able to consider the bug
dispassionately.

<p>Both explanations accurately model hacker psychology, and should be
considered complementary rather than competing.

<h3>Comparatives</h3>

<p>Finally, note that many words in hacker jargon have to be
understood as members of sets of comparatives.  This is especially
true of the adjectives and nouns used to describe the beauty and
functional quality of code.  Here is an approximately correct
spectrum:

<blockquote>
monstrosity  brain-damage  screw  bug  lose  misfeature<br>
crock  kluge  hack  win  feature  elegance  perfection
</blockquote>

<p>The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute, approximated but never
actually attained.  Another similar scale is used for describing the
reliability of software:

<blockquote>
broken  flaky  dodgy  fragile  brittle<br>
solid  robust  bulletproof  armor-plated
</blockquote>

<p>Note, however, that `dodgy' is primarily Commonwealth Hackish (it is
rare in the U.S.) and may change places with `flaky' for some
speakers.

<p>Coinages for describing <b><a href="#lossage">lossage</a></b> seem to call forth the very finest
in hackish linguistic inventiveness; it has been truly said that
hackers have even more words for equipment failures than Yiddish has
for obnoxious people.

<h2>Hacker Writing Style</h2>

<p>We've already seen that hackers often coin jargon by overgeneralizing
grammatical rules.  This is one aspect of a more general fondness for
form-versus-content language jokes that shows up particularly in
hackish writing.  One correspondent reports that he consistently
misspells `wrong' as `worng'.  Others have been known to criticize
glitches in Jargon File drafts by observing (in the mode of Douglas
Hofstadter) "This sentence no verb", or "Too repetetetive", or
"Bad speling", or "Incorrectspa cing."  Similarly, intentional
spoonerisms are often made of phrases relating to confusion or things
that are confusing; `dain bramage' for `brain damage' is perhaps the
most common (similarly, a hacker would be likely to write "Excuse me,
I'm cixelsyd today", rather than "I'm dyslexic today").  This sort
of thing is quite common and is enjoyed by all concerned.

<p>Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses,
much to the dismay of American editors.  Thus, if "Jim is going" is
a phrase, and so are "Bill runs" and "Spock groks", then hackers
generally prefer to write: "Jim is going", "Bill runs", and
"Spock groks".  This is incorrect according to standard American
usage (which would put the continuation commas and the final period
inside the string quotes); however, it is counter-intuitive to hackers
to mutilate literal strings with characters that don't belong in them. 
Given the sorts of examples that can come up in discussions of
programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading. 
When communicating command lines or small pieces of code, extra
characters can be a real pain in the neck.

<p>Consider, for example, a sentence in a <b><a href="#vi">vi</a></b> tutorial that looks like this:

<blockquote>
Then delete a line from the file by typing "dd". 
</blockquote>

<p>Standard usage would make this

<blockquote>
Then delete a line from the file by typing "dd." 
</blockquote>

<p>but that would be very bad -- because the reader would be prone to
type the string d-d-dot, and it happens that in <code>vi(1)</code> dot
repeats the last command accepted.  The net result would be to delete
<em>two</em> lines!

<p>The Jargon File follows hackish usage throughout.

<p>Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great
Britain, though the older style (which became established for
typographical reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and
quotes in typeset text) is still accepted there.  "Hart's Rules"
and the "Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors" call the
hacker-like style `new' or `logical' quoting.  This returns British
English to the style many other languages (including Spanish, French,
Italian, Catalan, and German) have been using all along.

<p>Another hacker habit is a tendency to distinguish between `scare'
quotes and `speech' quotes; that is, to use British-style single
quotes for marking and reserve American-style double quotes for actual
reports of speech or text included from elsewhere.  Interestingly,
some authorities describe this as correct general usage, but
mainstream American English has gone to using double-quotes
indiscriminately enough that hacker usage appears marked [and, in
fact, I thought this was a personal quirk of mine until I checked with
Usenet --ESR].  One further permutation that is definitely
<em>not</em> standard is a hackish tendency to do marking quotes by
using apostrophes (single quotes) in pairs; that is, 'like this'. 
This is modelled on string and character literal syntax in some
programming languages (reinforced by the fact that many character-only
terminals display the apostrophe in typewriter style, as a vertical
single quote).

<p>One quirk that shows up frequently in the <b><a href="#email">email</a></b> style of Unix
hackers in particular is a tendency for some things that are normally
all-lowercase (including usernames and the names of commands and
C routines) to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the
beginning of sentences.  It is clear that, for many hackers, the case
of such identifiers becomes a part of their internal representation
(the `spelling') and cannot be overridden without mental effort (an
appropriate reflex because Unix and C both distinguish cases and
confusing them can lead to <b><a href="#lossage">lossage</a></b>).  A way of escaping this dilemma
is simply to avoid using these constructions at the beginning of
sentences.

<p>There seems to be a meta-rule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to
the effect that precision of expression is more important than
conformance to traditional rules; where the latter create ambiguity or
lose information they can be discarded without a second thought.  It
is notable in this respect that other hackish inventions (for example,
in vocabulary) also tend to carry very precise shades of meaning even
when constructed to appear slangy and loose.  In fact, to a hacker,
the contrast between `loose' form and `tight' content in jargon is a
substantial part of its humor!

<p>Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis
conventions adapted to single-font all-ASCII communications links, and
these are occasionally carried over into written documents even when
normal means of font changes, underlining, and the like are available.

<p>One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS `LOUD', and
this becomes such an ingrained synesthetic reflex that a person who
goes to caps-lock while in <b><a href="#talk%20mode">talk mode</a></b> may be asked to "stop
shouting, please, you're hurting my ears!".

<p>Also, it is common to use bracketing with unusual characters to
signify emphasis.  The asterisk is most common, as in "What the
*hell*?" even though this interferes with the common use of the
asterisk suffix as a footnote mark.  The underscore is also common,
suggesting underlining (this is particularly common with book titles;
for example, "It is often alleged that Joe Haldeman wrote
_The_Forever_War_ as a rebuttal to Robert Heinlein's earlier novel of
the future military, _Starship_Troopers_.").  Other forms exemplified
by "=hell=", "\hell/", or "/hell/" are occasionally seen (it's
claimed that in the last example the first slash pushes the letters
over to the right to make them italic, and the second keeps them from
falling over).  On FidoNet, you might see #bright# and ^dark^ text,
which was actually interpreted by some reader software.  Finally,
words may also be emphasized L&nbsp;I&nbsp;K&nbsp;E&nbsp;T&nbsp;H&nbsp;I&nbsp;S, or by a series of
carets (^) under them on the next line of the text.

<p>There is a semantic difference between *emphasis like this* (which
emphasizes the phrase as a whole), and *emphasis* *like* *this* (which
suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if to a
very young child or a mentally impaired person).  Bracketing a word with
the `*' character may also indicate that the writer wishes readers to
consider that an action is taking place or that a sound is being made. 
Examples: *bang*, *hic*, *ring*, *grin*, *kick*, *stomp*, *mumble*.

<p>One might also see the above sound effects as &lt;bang&gt;, &lt;hic&gt;, &lt;ring&gt;,
&lt;grin&gt;, &lt;kick&gt;, &lt;stomp&gt;, &lt;mumble&gt;.  This use of angle brackets to mark
their contents originally derives from conventions used in <b><a href="#BNF">BNF</a></b>,
but since about 1993 it has been reinforced by the HTML markup used on
the World Wide Web.

<p>Angle-bracket enclosure is also used to indicate that a term stands
for some <b><a href="#random">random</a></b> member of a larger class (this is straight from
<b><a href="#BNF">BNF</a></b>). Examples like the following are common:

<pre>So this &lt;ethnic&gt; walks into a bar one day...
</pre>

<p>There is also an accepted convention for `writing under erasure'; the
text

<pre>Be nice to this fool^H^H^H^Hgentleman,
he's visiting from corporate HQ.
</pre>

<p>reads roughly as "Be nice to this fool, er, gentleman<small>...</small>", with
irony emphasized.  The digraph ^H is often used as a print
representation for a backspace, and was actually very visible on
old-style printing terminals. As the text was being composed the
characters would be echoed and printed immediately, and when a
correction was made the backspace keystrokes would be echoed with the
string '^H'.  Of course, the final composed text would have no trace
of the backspace characters (or the original erroneous text).

<p>Accidental writing under erasure occurs when using the Unix "talk"
program to chat interactively to another user. On a PC-style keyboard
most users instinctively press the backspace key to delete mistakes,
but this may not achieve the desired effect, and merely displays a ^H
symbol. The user typically presses backspace a few times before their
brain realises the problem - especially likely if the user is a
touch-typist - and since each character is transmitted as soon as it
is typed, Freudian slips and other inadvertant admissions are (barring
network delays) clearly visible for the other user to see.

<p>Deliberate use of ^H for writing under erasure parallels (and may have
been influenced by) the ironic use of `slashouts' in science-fiction
fanzines.

<p>A related habit uses editor commands to signify corrections to
previous text.  This custom faded in email as more mailers got
good editing capabilities, only to take on new life on IRCs
and other line-based chat systems.

<pre>charlie: I've seen that term used on alt.foobar often.
lisa: Send it to Erik for the File.
lisa: Oops...s/Erik/Eric/.
</pre>

<p>The s/Erik/Eric/ says "change Erik to Eric in the preceding".  This
syntax is borrowed from the Unix editing tools <code>ed</code> and
<code>sed</code>, but is widely recognized by non-Unix hackers as well.

<p>In a formula, <code>*</code> signifies multiplication but two asterisks in a
row are a shorthand for exponentiation (this derives from FORTRAN, and
is also used in Ada).  Thus, one might write 2&nbsp;**&nbsp;8&nbsp;=&nbsp;256.

<p>Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the
caret (^, ASCII 1011110); one might write instead <code>2^8&nbsp;=&nbsp;256</code>.  This goes all the way back to Algol-60, which used the archaic
ASCII `up-arrow' that later became the caret; this was picked up by
Kemeny and Kurtz's original BASIC, which in turn influenced the design
of the <code>bc(1)</code> and <code>dc(1)</code> Unix tools, which have probably
done most to reinforce the convention on Usenet. (TeX math mode also
uses ^ for exponention.) The notation is mildly confusing to C
programmers, because <code>^</code> means bitwise exclusive-or in C. 
Despite this, it was favored 3:1 over ** in a late-1990 snapshot of
Usenet.  It is used consistently in this lexicon.

<p>In on-line exchanges, hackers tend to use decimal forms or improper
fractions (`3.5' or `7/2') rather than `typewriter style' mixed
fractions (`3-1/2').  The major motive here is probably that the
former are more readable in a monospaced font, together with a desire
to avoid the risk that the latter might be read as `three minus
one-half'.  The decimal form is definitely preferred for fractions
with a terminating decimal representation; there may be some cultural
influence here from the high status of scientific notation.

<p>Another on-line convention, used especially for very large or very
small numbers, is taken from C (which derived it from FORTRAN).  This
is a form of `scientific notation' using `e' to replace `*10^'; for
example, one year is about 3e7 seconds
long.

<p>The tilde (~) is commonly used in a quantifying sense of
`approximately'; that is, <code>~50</code> means `about fifty'.

<p>On Usenet and in the <b><a href="#MUD">MUD</a></b> world, common C boolean, logical, and
relational operators such as <code>|</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>,
<code>!</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and
<code>&lt;=</code> are often combined with English.  The Pascal not-equals,
<code>&lt;&gt;</code>, is also recognized, and occasionally one sees <code>/=</code> for
not-equals (from Ada, Common Lisp, and Fortran 90).  The use of prefix
`!' as a loose synonym for `not-' or `no-' is particularly common;
thus, `!clue' is read `no-clue' or `clueless'.

<p>A related practice borrows syntax from preferred programming languages
to express ideas in a natural-language text.  For example, one might
see the following:

<pre>In &lt;jrh578689@thudpucker.com&gt; J. R. Hacker wrote:
&gt;I recently had occasion to field-test the Snafu
&gt;Systems 2300E adaptive gonkulator.  The price was
&gt;right, and the racing stripe on the case looked
&gt;kind of neat, but its performance left something
&gt;to be desired.

Yeah, I tried one out too.

#ifdef FLAME
Hasn't anyone told those idiots that you can't get

#endif /* FLAME */

I guess they figured the price premium for true

Unfortunately, it's also the only workable approach.
I wouldn't recommend purchase of this product unless
you're on a *very* tight budget.

#include &lt;disclaimer.h&gt;
--
                 == Frank Foonly (Fubarco Systems)
</pre>


<br><p>
<p>In the above, the <code>#ifdef</code>/<code>#endif</code> pair is a conditional
compilation syntax from C; here, it implies that the text between
(which is a <b><a href="#flame">flame</a></b>) should be evaluated only if you have turned on
(or defined on) the switch FLAME.  The <code>#include</code> at the end is C
for "include standard disclaimer here"; the `standard disclaimer' is
understood to read, roughly, "These are my personal opinions and not
to be construed as the official position of my employer."

<p>The top section in the example, with &gt; at the left margin, is an
example of an inclusion convention we'll discuss below.

<p>More recently, following on the huge popularity of the World Wide Web,
pseudo-HTML markup has become popular for similar purposes:

<pre>&lt;flame&gt;
Your father was a hamster and your mother smelt of elderberries!
&lt;/flame&gt;
</pre>


<br><p>
<p>You'll even see this with an HTML-style modifier:

<pre>&lt;flame intensity="100%"&gt;
You seem well-suited for a career in government.
&lt;/flame&gt;
</pre>


<br><p>
<p>Another recent (late 1990s) construction now common on Usenet seems to
be borrowed from Unix shell syntax or Perl.  It consists of using a
dollar sign before an uppercased form of a word or acronym to suggest
any <b><a href="#random">random</a></b> member of the class indicated by the word.  Thus:
`$PHB' means "any random member of the class `Pointy-Haired Boss'".

<p>Hackers also mix letters and numbers more freely than in mainstream
usage.  In particular, it is good hackish style to write a digit
sequence where you intend the reader to understand the text string
that names that number in English.  So, hackers prefer to write
`1970s' rather than `nineteen-seventies' or `1970's' (the latter looks
like a possessive).

<p>It should also be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to
use multiply-nested parentheses than is normal in English.  Part of
this is almost certainly due to influence from LISP (which uses deeply
nested parentheses (like this (see?)) in its syntax a lot), but it has
also been suggested that a more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing
with complexity and pushing systems to their limits is in
operation.

<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that many studies of on-line
communication have shown that electronic links have a de-inhibiting
effect on people.  Deprived of the body-language cues through which
emotional state is expressed, people tend to forget everything about
other parties except what is presented over that ASCII link.  This has
both good and bad effects.  A good one is that it encourages honesty
and tends to break down hierarchical authority relationships; a bad
one is that it may encourage depersonalization and gratuitous
rudeness.  Perhaps in response to this, experienced netters often
display a sort of conscious formal <i>politesse</i> in their writing that
has passed out of fashion in other spoken and written media (for
example, the phrase "Well said, sir!" is not uncommon).

<p>Many introverted hackers who are next to inarticulate in person
communicate with considerable fluency over the net, perhaps precisely
because they can forget on an unconscious level that they are dealing
with people and thus don't feel stressed and anxious as they would
face to face.

<p>Though it is considered gauche to publicly criticize posters for poor
spelling or grammar, the network places a premium on literacy and
clarity of expression.  It may well be that future historians of
literature will see in it a revival of the great tradition of personal
letters as art.

<h2>Email Quotes and Inclusion Conventions</h2>

<p>One area where conventions for on-line writing are still in some flux
is the marking of included material from earlier messages -- what
would be called `block quotations' in ordinary English.  From the
usual typographic convention employed for these (smaller font at an
extra indent), there derived a practice of included text being
indented by one ASCII TAB (0001001) character, which under Unix and
many other environments gives the appearance of an 8-space indent.

<p>Early mail and netnews readers had no facility for including messages
this way, so people had to paste in copy manually.  BSD <code>Mail(1)</code>
was the first message agent to support inclusion, and early Usenetters
emulated its style.  But the TAB character tended to push included
text too far to the right (especially in multiply nested inclusions),
leading to ugly wraparounds.  After a brief period of confusion
(during which an inclusion leader consisting of three or four spaces
became established in EMACS and a few mailers), the use of leading <code>&gt;</code>
or <code>&gt;&nbsp;</code> became standard, perhaps owing to its use in <code>ed(1)</code> to
display tabs (alternatively, it may derive from the <code>&gt;</code> that some
early Unix mailers used to quote lines starting with "From" in text,
so they wouldn't look like the beginnings of new message headers). 
Inclusions within inclusions keep their <code>&gt;</code> leaders, so the `nesting
level' of a quotation is visually apparent.

<p>The practice of including text from the parent article when posting a
followup helped solve what had been a major nuisance on Usenet: the
fact that articles do not arrive at different sites in the same order. 
Careless posters used to post articles that would begin with, or even
consist entirely of, "No, that's wrong" or "I agree" or the like. 
It was hard to see who was responding to what.  Consequently, around
1984, new news-posting software evolved a facility to automatically
include the text of a previous article, marked with "&gt;&nbsp;" or whatever
the poster chose.  The poster was expected to delete all but the
relevant lines.  The result has been that, now, careless posters post
articles containing the <em>entire</em> text of a preceding article,
<em>followed</em> only by "No, that's wrong" or "I agree".

<p>Many people feel that this cure is worse than the original disease,
and there soon appeared newsreader software designed to let the reader
skip over included text if desired.  Today, some posting software
rejects articles containing too high a proportion of lines beginning
with `&gt;' -- but this too has led to undesirable workarounds, such as the
deliberate inclusion of zero-content filler lines which aren't quoted
and thus pull the message below the rejection threshold.

<p>Because the default mailers supplied with Unix and other operating
systems haven't evolved as quickly as human usage, the older
conventions using a leading TAB or three or four spaces are still
alive; however, &gt;-inclusion is now clearly the prevalent form in both
netnews and mail.

<p>Inclusion practice is still evolving, and disputes over the `correct' inclusion
style occasionally lead to <b><a href="#holy%20wars">holy wars</a></b>.

<p>Most netters view an inclusion as a promise that comment on it will
immediately follow.  The preferred, conversational style looks like this,

<pre>     &gt; relevant excerpt 1
     response to excerpt
     &gt; relevant excerpt 2
     response to excerpt
     &gt; relevant excerpt 3
     response to excerpt
</pre>

<p>or for short messages like this:

<pre>     &gt; entire message
     response to message
</pre>

<p>Thanks to poor design of some PC-based mail agents, one will occasionally see
the entire quoted message <em>after</em> the response, like this

<pre>     response to message
     &gt; entire message
</pre>

<p>but this practice is strongly deprecated.

<p>Though <code>&gt;</code> remains the standard inclusion leader, <code>|</code> is
occasionally used for extended quotations where original variations in
indentation are being retained (one mailer even combines these and
uses <code>|&gt;</code>).  One also sees different styles of quoting a number
of authors in the same message: one (deprecated because it loses
information) uses a leader of <code>&gt;&nbsp;</code> for everyone, another (the
most common) is <code>&gt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</code>, <code>&gt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</code>, etc. (or
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, etc., depending on line length and
nesting depth) reflecting the original order of messages, and yet
another is to use a different citation leader for each author, say
<code>&gt;&nbsp;</code>, <code>:&nbsp;</code>, <code>|&nbsp;</code>, <code>}&nbsp;</code>
(preserving nesting so that the inclusion order of messages is still
apparent, or tagging the inclusions with authors' names).  Yet
<em>another</em> style is to use each poster's initials (or login name)
as a citation leader for that poster.

<p>Occasionally one sees a <code>#&nbsp;</code> leader used for quotations from
authoritative sources such as standards documents; the intended
allusion is to the root prompt (the special Unix command prompt issued
when one is running as the privileged super-user).

<h2>Hacker Speech Style</h2>

<p>Hackish speech generally features extremely precise diction, careful
word choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively
little use of contractions or street slang.  Dry humor, irony, puns,
and a mildly flippant attitude are highly valued -- but an underlying
seriousness and intelligence are essential.  One should use just
enough jargon to communicate precisely and identify oneself as a
member of the culture; overuse of jargon or a breathless, excessively
gung-ho attitude is considered tacky and the mark of a loser.

<p>This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally
spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical
fields.  In contrast with the methods of jargon construction, it is
fairly constant throughout hackerdom.

<p>It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative
questions -- or, at least, that the people to whom they are talking
are often confused by the sense of their answers.  The problem is that
they have done so much programming that distinguishes between

<pre><tt>if (going) ...</tt>
</pre>

<p>and

<pre><tt>if (!going) ...</tt>
</pre>

<p>that when they parse the question "Aren't you going?" it may seem to
be asking the opposite question from "Are you going?", and so to
merit an answer in the opposite sense.  This confuses
English-speaking non-hackers because they were taught to answer as
though the negative part weren't there.  In some other languages
(including Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) the hackish interpretation
is standard and the problem wouldn't arise.  Hackers often find
themselves wishing for a word like French `si', German `doch', or
Dutch `jawel' - a word with which one could unambiguously
answer `yes' to a negative question.  (See also <b><a href="#mu">mu</a></b>)

<p>For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use double
negatives, even if they live in a region where colloquial usage
allows them.  The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be
an affirmative knowing it will be misparsed as a negative tends to
disturb them.

<p>In a related vein, hackers sometimes make a game of answering
questions containing logical connectives with a strictly literal
rather than colloquial interpretation.  A non-hacker who is indelicate
enough to ask a question like "So, are you working on finding that
bug <em>now</em> or leaving it until later?"  is likely to get the
perfectly correct answer "Yes!" (that is, "Yes, I'm doing it either
now or later, and you didn't ask which!").

<h2>International Style</h2>

<p>Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage
in American English, we have made some effort to get input from
abroad.  Though the hacker-speak of other languages often uses
translations of jargon from English (often as transmitted to them by
earlier Jargon File versions!), the local variations are interesting,
and knowledge of them may be of some use to travelling hackers.

<p>There are some references herein to `Commonwealth hackish'.  These are
intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in
the English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth (Canada,
Australia, India, etc. -- though Canada is heavily influenced by
American usage).  There is also an entry on <b><a href="#Commonwealth%20Hackish">Commonwealth Hackish</a></b>
reporting some general phonetic and vocabulary differences from
U.S. hackish.

<p>Hackers in Western Europe and (especially) Scandinavia report that
they often use a mixture of English and their native languages for
technical conversation.  Occasionally they develop idioms in their
English usage that are influenced by their native-language styles. 
Some of these are reported here.

<p>On the other hand, English often gives rise to grammatical and
vocabulary mutations in the native language.  For example, Italian
hackers often use the nonexistent verbs `scrollare' (to scroll) and
`deletare' (to delete) rather than native Italian `scorrere' and
`cancellare'.  Similarly, the English verb `to hack' has been seen
conjugated in Swedish.  In German, many Unix terms in English are
casually declined as if they were German verbs - thus:
mount/mounten/gemountet; grep/grepen/gegrept; fork/forken/geforkt;
core dump/core-dumpen, core-gedumpt.  And Spanish-speaking hackers use
`linkear' (to link), `debugear' (to debug), and `lockear' (to
lock).

<p>European hackers report that this happens partly because the English
terms make finer distinctions than are available in their native
vocabularies, and partly because deliberate language-crossing makes
for amusing wordplay.

<p>A few notes on hackish usages in Russian have been added where they
are parallel with English idioms and thus comprehensible to
English-speakers.

<h2>Crackers, Phreaks, and Lamers</h2>

<p>From the early 1980s onward, a flourishing culture of local, MS-DOS-based
bulletin boards developed separately from Internet hackerdom.  The
BBS culture has, as its seamy underside, a stratum of `pirate boards'
inhabited by <b><a href="#cracker">cracker</a></b>s, phone phreaks, and <b><a href="#warez%20d00dz">warez d00dz</a></b>.  These
people (mostly teenagers running IBM-PC clones from their bedrooms) have
developed their own characteristic jargon, heavily influenced by skateboard
lingo and underground-rock slang.

<p>Though crackers often call themselves `hackers', they aren't (they
typically have neither significant programming ability, nor Internet
expertise, nor experience with UNIX or other true multi-user systems). 
Their vocabulary has little overlap with hackerdom's.  Nevertheless,
this lexicon covers much of it so the reader will be able to
understand what goes by on bulletin-board systems.

<p>Here is a brief guide to cracker and <b><a href="#warez%20d00dz">warez d00dz</a></b> usage:

<ul>
<li>Misspell frequently.  The substitutions

<pre>     phone =&gt; fone
     freak =&gt; phreak
</pre>

<p>are obligatory. 
</p><li>Always substitute `z's for `s's.  (i.e. "codes" -&gt; "codez"). 
The substitution of 'z' for 's' has evolved so that a 'z' is now
systematically put at the end of words to denote an illegal or
cracking connection. Examples : Appz, passwordz, passez, utilz, MP3z,
distroz, pornz, sitez, gamez, crackz, serialz, downloadz, FTPz, etc. 
<li>Type random emphasis characters after a post line (i.e. "Hey Dudes!#!$#$!#!$"). 
<li>Use the emphatic `k' prefix ("k-kool", "k-rad", "k-awesome") frequently. 
<li>Abbreviate compulsively ("I got lotsa warez w/ docs"). 
<li>Substitute `0' for `o' ("r0dent", "l0zer"). 
<li>TYPE ALL IN CAPS LOCK, SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YELLING ALL THE TIME. 
</ul>

<p>These traits are similar to those of <b><a href="#B1FF">B1FF</a></b>, who originated as a
parody of naive <b><a href="#BBS">BBS</a></b> users; also of his latter-day equivalent
<b><a href="#Jeff%20K.">Jeff K.</a></b>.  Occasionally, this sort of distortion may
be used as heavy sarcasm by a real hacker, as in:

<pre>    &gt; I got X Windows running under Linux!

    d00d!  u R an 31337 hax0r
</pre>

<p>The only practice resembling this in actual hacker usage is the
substitution of a dollar sign of `s' in names of products or service
felt to be excessively expensive, e.g. Compu$erve, Micro$oft.

subculture, see <b><a href="#lamer">lamer</a></b>, <b><a href="#elite">elite</a></b>, <b><a href="#leech">leech</a></b>, <b><a href="#poser">poser</a></b>,

<h2>Pronunciation Guide</h2>

<p>Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listings for all entries
that are neither dictionary words pronounced as in standard English
nor obvious compounds thereof.  Slashes bracket phonetic
pronunciations, which are to be interpreted using the following
conventions:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Syllables are hyphen-separated, except that an accent or back-accent
follows each accented syllable (the back-accent marks a secondary
accent in some words of four or more syllables).  If no accent is
given, the word is pronounced with equal accentuation on all syllables
(this is common for abbreviations).

<li>Consonants are pronounced as in American English.  The letter `g' is
always hard (as in "got" rather than "giant"); `ch' is soft
("church" rather than "chemist").  The letter `j' is the sound
that occurs twice in "judge".  The letter `s' is always as in
"pass", never a z sound.  The digraph `kh' is the guttural of
"loch" or "l'chaim".  The digraph 'gh' is the aspirated g+h of
"bughouse" or "ragheap" (rare in English).

<li>Uppercase letters are pronounced as their English letter names; thus
(for example) /H-L-L/ is equivalent to /aych el el/.  /Z/ may
be pronounced /zee/ or /zed/ depending on your local dialect.

<li>Vowels are represented as follows:

<dl>
<dt>/a/
<dd>  back, that
<br><dt>/ah/
<dd>  father, palm (see note)
<dt>/ar/
<dd>  far, mark
<dt>/aw/
<dd>  flaw, caught
<dt>/ay/
<dd>  bake, rain
<dt>/e/
<dd>  less, men
<dt>/ee/
<dd>  easy, ski
<dt>/eir/
<dd>  their, software
<dt>/i/
<dd>  trip, hit
<dt>/i:/
<dd>  life, sky
<dt>/o/
<dd>  block, stock (see note)
<dt>/oh/
<dd>  flow, sew
<dt>/oo/
<dd>  loot, through
<dt>/or/
<dd>  more, door
<dt>/ow/
<dd>  out, how
<dt>/oy/
<dd>  boy, coin
<dt>/uh/
<dd>  but, some
<dt>/u/
<dd>  put, foot
<dt>/y/
<dd>  yet, young
<dt>/yoo/
<dd>  few, chew
<dt>/[y]oo/
<dd>  /oo/ with optional fronting as in `news' (/nooz/ or /nyooz/)
</dl>
</ol>

<p>The glyph /*/ is used for the `schwa' sound of unstressed or occluded
vowels (the one that is often written with an upside-down `e'). 
The schwa vowel is omitted in syllables containing vocalic r, l, m or
n; that is, `kitten' and `color' would be rendered /kit'n/ and
/kuhl'r/, not /kit'*n/ and /kuhl'*r/.

<p>Note that the above table reflects mainly distinctions found in
standard American English (that is, the neutral dialect spoken by TV
network announcers and typical of educated speech in the Upper
Midwest, Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Philadelphia). 
However, we separate /o/ from /ah/, which tend to merge in
standard American.  This may help readers accustomed to accents
resembling British Received Pronunciation.

<p>The intent of this scheme is to permit as many readers as possible to
map the pronunciations into their local dialect by ignoring some
subset of the distinctions we make.  Speakers of British RP, for example,
can smash terminal /r/ and all unstressed vowels.  Speakers of many
varieties of southern American will automatically map /o/ to /aw/; and
so forth.  (Standard American makes a good reference dialect for this purpose
because it has crisp consonants and more vowel distinctions than other
major dialects, and tends to retain distinctions between unstressed
vowels.  It also happens to be what your editor speaks.)

<p>Entries with a pronunciation of `//' are written-only usages.  (No,
Unix weenies, this does <em>not</em> mean `pronounce like previous
pronunciation'!)

<h2>Other Lexicon Conventions</h2>

<p>Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than
the letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in
mainstream dictionaries), except that all entries beginning with
nonalphabetic characters are sorted before A.  The case-blindness is a
feature, not a bug.

<p>The beginning of each entry is marked by a colon (<code>:</code>) at the
left margin.  This convention helps out tools like hypertext browsers
that benefit from knowing where entry boundaries are, but aren't as
context-sensitive as humans.

<p>In pure ASCII renderings of the Jargon File, you will see {} used
to bracket words which themselves have entries in the File. 
This isn't done all the time for every such word, but it is done
everywhere that a reminder seems useful that the term has a jargon
meaning and one might wish to refer to its entry.

<p>In this all-ASCII version, headwords for topic entries are
distinguished from those for ordinary entries by being followed by
"::" rather than ":"; similarly, references are surrounded by
"{{" and "}}" rather than "{" and "}".

<p>Defining instances of terms and phrases appear in `slanted type'.  A
defining instance is one which occurs near to or as part of an
explanation of it.

<p>Prefix ** is used as linguists do; to mark examples of incorrect usage.

<p>We follow the `logical' quoting convention described in the Writing
Style section above.  In addition, we reserve double quotes for actual
excerpts of text or (sometimes invented) speech.  Scare quotes (which
mark a word being used in a nonstandard way), and philosopher's quotes
(which turn an utterance into the string of letters or words that name
it) are both rendered with single quotes.

<p>References such as <code>malloc(3)</code> and <code>patch(1)</code> are to Unix
facilities (some of which, such as <code>patch(1)</code>, are actually
open source distributed over Usenet).  The Unix manuals use
<code>foo(n)</code> to refer to item foo in section (n) of the
manual, where n=1 is utilities, n=2 is system calls,
n=3 is C library routines, n=6 is games, and
n=8 (where present) is system administration utilities. 
Sections 4, 5, and 7 of the manuals have changed roles frequently and
in any case are not referred to in any of the entries.

<p>Various abbreviations used frequently in the lexicon are summarized here:

<p>Where alternate spellings or pronunciations are given, <i>alt.</i>
separates two possibilities with nearly equal distribution, while

<p>Where a term can be attributed to a particular subculture or is known
to have originated there, we have tried to so indicate.  Here is a

<br><p>
<p>Some other etymology abbreviations such as <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b> and <b><a href="#PDP-10">PDP-10</a></b>
refer to technical cultures surrounding specific operating systems,
processors, or other environments.  The fact that a term is labelled
with any one of these abbreviations does not necessarily mean its use
is confined to that culture.  In particular, many terms labelled `MIT'
and `Stanford' are in quite general use.  We have tried to give some
indication of the distribution of speakers in the usage notes;
however, a number of factors mentioned in the introduction conspire to
make these indications less definite than might be desirable.

<p>A few new definitions attached to entries are marked [proposed]. 
These are usually generalizations suggested by editors or Usenet
respondents in the process of commenting on previous definitions of
those entries.  These are <em>not</em> represented as established
jargon.

<h2>Format For New Entries</h2>

<p>You can mail submissions for the Jargon File to
<a href="mailto:jargon@snark.thyrsus.com">jargon@snark.thyrsus.com</a>.

<p>We welcome new jargon, and corrections to or amplifications of
existing entries.  You can improve your submission's chances of being
included by adding background information on user population and years
of currency.  References to actual usage via URLs and/or DejaNews
pointers are particularly welcomed.

<p>All contributions and suggestions about the Jargon File will be
considered donations to be placed in the public domain as part of this
File, and may be used in subsequent paper editions.  Submissions may
be edited for accuracy, clarity and concision.

<p>We are looking to expand the File's range of technical specialties covered. 
There are doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the scientific
computing, graphics, and networking hacker communities; also in numerical
analysis, computer architectures and VLSI design, language design, and many
other related fields.  Send us your jargon!

<p>We are <em>not</em> interested in straight technical terms explained by
textbooks or technical dictionaries unless an entry illuminates
`underground' meanings or aspects not covered by official histories. 
We are also not interested in `joke' entries -- there is a lot of
humor in the file but it must flow naturally out of the explanations
of what hackers do and how they think.

<p>It is OK to submit items of jargon you have originated if they have spread
to the point of being used by people who are not personally acquainted with
you.  We prefer items to be attested by independent submission from two
different sites.

<p>An HTML version of the File is available at http://www.tuxedo.org/jargon. 
Please send us URLs for materials related to the entries, so we can
enrich the File's link structure.

<p>The Jargon File will be regularly maintained and made available for
browsing on the World Wide Web, and will include a version number. 
Read it, pass it around, contribute -- this is <em>your</em> monument!

<p><b>0</b> <p>
 Numeric zero, as opposed to the letter `O' (the 15th
   letter of the English alphabet).  In their unmodified forms they
   look a lot alike, and various kluges invented to make them visually
   distinct have compounded the confusion.  If your zero is
   center-dotted and letter-O is not, or if letter-O looks almost
   rectangular but zero looks more like an American football stood on
   end (or the reverse), you're probably looking at a modern character
   display (though the dotted zero seems to have originated as an
   option on IBM 3270 controllers).  If your zero is slashed but
   letter-O is not, you're probably looking at an old-style ASCII
   graphic set descended from the default typewheel on the venerable
   ASR-33 Teletype (Scandinavians, for whom &Oslash; is a letter, curse
   this arrangement).  (Interestingly, the slashed zero long predates
   computers; Florian Cajori's monumental "A History of
   Mathematical Notations" notes that it was used in the twelfth and
   thirteenth centuries.) If letter-O has a slash across it and the zero
   does not, your display is tuned for a very old convention used at
   IBM and a few other early mainframe makers (Scandinavians curse
   <em>this</em> arrangement even more, because it means two of their
   letters collide).  Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero
   with a <em>reversed</em> slash. Old CDC computers rendered letter O
   as an unbroken oval and 0 as an oval broken at upper right and
   lower left.  And yet another convention common on early line
   printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the
   letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital
   letter-O (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how to
   draw ASCII characters, but the final standard changed the
   distinguisher to a tick-mark in the upper-left corner).  Are we
   sufficiently confused yet?

   explicit forms 4.2BSD or (less commonly) BSD 4.2.  Similar remarks
   apply to "4.3", "4.4" and to earlier, less-widespread releases
   4.1 and 2.9.

<p><b>pred</b> // [Usenet; orig. fr Oxford University] Abbreviation for
   "predictable", used to signify or preempt reponses that are
   extremely predictable but have to be filled in for the sake of form
   (the phrase is bracketed by &lt;pred&gt;...&lt;/pred&gt;).  X-Pred headers in
   mail or news serve the same end.  Figuring out the connection
   between the X-Pred tagline and the thread is part of the
   entertainment.  For example, it is said that any thread about
   taxation must contain a reference to Raquel Welch, if only to stop
   other people from mentioning her.  This is allegedly due to a Monty
   Python sketch where a character declares that he would tax Raquel
   Welch, and he has a feeling she would tax him.

<p><b>@-party</b> /at'par`tee/ n. <p>
 [from the @-sign in an Internet
   address] (alt. `@-sign party' /at'si:n par`tee/) A
   semi-closed party thrown for hackers at a science-fiction
   convention (esp. the annual World Science Fiction Convention or
   "Worldcon"); one must have a <b><a href="#network%20address">network address</a></b> to get in, or
   at least be in company with someone who does.  One of the most
   reliable opportunities for hackers to meet face to face with people
   who might otherwise be represented by mere phosphor dots on their
   screens.  Compare <b><a href="#boink">boink</a></b>.

<p>The first recorded @-party was held at the Westercon (a
   U.S. western regional SF convention) over the July 4th weekend in
   1980.  It is not clear exactly when the canonical @-party venue
   shifted to the Worldcon but it had certainly become established by
   Constellation in 1983.  Sadly, the @-party tradition has been in
   decline since about 1996, mainly because having an @-address no
   longer functions as an effective lodge pin.

<p>We are informed, however, that <i>rec.skydiving</i> members have
   maintained a tradition of formation jumps in the shape of an @;

   capitalized, but may appear as `abend'.  Hackers will try to
   persuade you that ABEND is called `abend' because it is what
   system operators do to the machine late on Friday when they want to
   call it a day, and hence is from the German `Abend' = `Evening'. 
   2. [<i>alt.callahans</i>] Absent By Enforced Net Deprivation -
   used in the subject lines of postings warning friends of an
   imminent loss of Internet access.  (This can be because of computer
   downtime, loss of provider, moving or illness.)  Variants of this
   also appear: ABVND = `Absent By Voluntary Net Deprivation' and
   ABSEND = `Absent By Self-Enforced Net Deprivation' have been
   sighted.

<p><b>accumulator</b> n. obs. <p>
 1. Archaic term for a register.  On-line
   use of it as a synonym for `register' is a fairly reliable
   indication that the user has been around for quite a while and/or
   that the architecture under discussion is quite old.  The term in
   full is almost never used of microprocessor registers, for example,
   though symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in `A'
   derive from historical use of the term `accumulator' (and not,
   actually, from `arithmetic').  Confusingly, though, an `A'
   register name prefix may also stand for `address', as for
   example on the Motorola 680x0 family.  2. A register being used for
   arithmetic or logic (as opposed to addressing or a loop index),
   especially one being used to accumulate a sum or count of many
   items.  This use is in context of a particular routine or stretch
   of code.  "The FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an accumulator." 
   3. One's in-basket (esp. among old-timers who might use sense 1). 
   "You want this reviewed?  Sure, just put it in the accumulator." 
   (See <b><a href="#stack">stack</a></b>.)

<p><b>ACK</b> /ak/ interj. <p>
 1. [common; from the ASCII mnemonic
   for 0000110] Acknowledge.  Used to register one's presence (compare
   mainstream <em>Yo!</em>).  An appropriate response to <b><a href="#ping">ping</a></b> or
   <b><a href="#ENQ">ENQ</a></b>.  2. [from the comic strip "Bloom County"] An
   exclamation of surprised disgust, esp. in "Ack pffft!" 
   Semi-humorous.  Generally this sense is not spelled in caps (ACK)
   and is distinguished by a following exclamation point.  3. Used to
   politely interrupt someone to tell them you understand their point
   (see <b><a href="#NAK">NAK</a></b>).  Thus, for example, you might cut off an overly
   long explanation with "Ack.  Ack.  Ack.  I get it now".  4.  An
   affirmative. "Think we ought to ditch that damn NT server for
   a Linux box?" "ACK!"

<p>There is also a usage "ACK?" (from sense 1) meaning "Are you
   there?", often used in email when earlier mail has produced no
   reply, or during a lull in <b><a href="#talk%20mode">talk mode</a></b> to see if the person has
   gone away (the standard humorous response is of course <b><a href="#NAK">NAK</a></b>

<p><b>Acme</b> n. <p>
 [from Greek `akme', highest point of
   perfection or achievement] The canonical supplier of bizarre,
   elaborate, and non-functional gadgetry - where Rube Goldberg and
   Heath Robinson (two cartoonists who specialized in elaborate
   contraptions) shop.  The name has been humorously expanded as A (or
   American) Company Making Everything.  (In fact, Acme was a real
   brand sold from Sears Roebuck catalogs in the early 1900s.) 
   Describing some X as an "Acme X" either means "This is
   <b><a href="#insanely%20great">insanely great</a></b>", or, more likely, "This looks <b><a href="#insanely%20great">insanely great</a></b> on paper, but in practice it's really easy to shoot yourself
   in the foot with it."  Compare <b><a href="#pistol">pistol</a></b>.

<p>This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained
   here for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the
   Warner Brothers' series of "Roadrunner" cartoons.  In these
   cartoons, the famished Wile E. Coyote was forever attempting to
   catch up with, trap, and eat the Roadrunner.  His attempts usually
   involved one or more high-technology Rube Goldberg devices -
   rocket jetpacks, catapults, magnetic traps, high-powered
   slingshots, etc.  These were usually delivered in large wooden
   crates labeled prominently with the Acme name - which, probably
   not by coincidence, was the trade name of the animation rotation
   board used by cartoonists since forever. Acme devices invariably
   malfunctioned in improbable and violent ways.

 [Purdue] 1. Gratuitous
   assumptions made inside certain programs, esp. expert systems,
   which lead to the appearance of semi-intelligent behavior but are
   in fact entirely arbitrary.  For example, fuzzy-matching of
   input tokens that might be typing errors against a symbol table can
   make it look as though a program knows how to spell.

<p><b>Ada</b> n. <p>
 A <b><a href="#Pascal">Pascal</a></b>-descended language that was at one

   the Pentagon.  Hackers are nearly unanimous in observing that,

   of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee, crockish, difficult
   to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar boondoggle
   (one common description was "The PL/I of the 1980s").  Hackers
   find Ada's exception-handling and inter-process communication
   features particularly hilarious.  Ada Lovelace (the daughter of
   Lord Byron who became the world's first programmer while
   cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his mechanical
   computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly blanch
   at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the kindest

<p><b>ADVENT</b> /ad'vent/ n. <p>
 The prototypical computer
   adventure game, first designed by Will Crowther on the <b><a href="#PDP-10">PDP-10</a></b>
   in the mid-1970s as an attempt at computer-refereed fantasy gaming,
   and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford
   in 1976. (Woods had been one of the authors of <b><a href="#INTERCAL">INTERCAL</a></b>.) Now
   better known as Adventure or Colossal Cave Adventure, but the
   <b><a href="#TOPS-10">TOPS-10</a></b> operating system permitted only six-letter filenames. 
   See also <b><a href="#vadding">vadding</a></b>, <b><a href="#Zork">Zork</a></b>, and <b><a href="#Infocom">Infocom</a></b>.

<p>This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in
   text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have
   become fixtures of hacker-speak:  "A huge green fierce snake bars
   the way!"  "I see no X here" (for some noun X).  "You are in a
   maze of twisty little passages, all alike."  "You are in a little
   maze of twisty passages, all different."  The `magic words'
   <b><a href="#xyzzy">xyzzy</a></b> and <b><a href="#plugh">plugh</a></b> also derive from this game.

<p>Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the
   Mammoth &amp; Flint Ridge cave system; it actually <em>has</em> a
   `Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that
   also turns up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary
   entrance.

<p><b>AI-complete</b> /A-I k*m-pleet'/ adj. <p>
 [MIT, Stanford: by
   analogy with `NP-complete' (see <b><a href="#NP-">NP-</a></b>)] Used to describe
   problems or subproblems in AI, to indicate that the solution
   presupposes a solution to the `strong AI problem' (that is, the
   synthesis of a human-level intelligence).  A problem that is
   AI-complete is, in other words, just too hard.

<p>Examples of AI-complete problems are `The Vision Problem'
   (building a system that can see as well as a human) and `The
   Natural Language Problem' (building a system that can understand
   and speak a natural language as well as a human).  These may appear
   to be modular, but all attempts so far (1999) to solve them have
   foundered on the amount of context information and `intelligence'
   they seem to require. See also <b><a href="#gedanken">gedanken</a></b>.

<p><b>Alderson loop</b> n. <p>
 [Intel] A special version of an
   <b><a href="#infinite%20loop">infinite loop</a></b> where there is an exit condition available, but
   inaccessible in the current implementation of the code.  Typically
   this is created while debugging user interface code.  An example
   would be when there is a menu stating, "Select 1-3 or 9 to quit"
   and 9 is not allowed by the function that takes the selection from
   the user.

<p>This term received its name from a programmer who had coded a modal
   message box in MSAccess with no Ok or Cancel buttons, thereby
   disabling the entire program whenever the box came up.  The message
   box had the proper code for dismissal and even was set up so that
   when the non-existent Ok button was pressed the proper code would
   be called.

<p><b>aliasing bug</b> n. <p>
 A class of subtle programming errors that
   can arise in code that does dynamic allocation, esp. via
   <code>malloc(3)</code> or equivalent.  If several pointers address
   (`aliases for') a given hunk of storage, it may happen that the
   storage is freed or reallocated (and thus moved) through one alias
   and then referenced through another, which may lead to subtle (and
   possibly intermittent) lossage depending on the state and the
   allocation history of the malloc <b><a href="#arena">arena</a></b>.  Avoidable by use of
   allocation strategies that never alias allocated core, or by use of
   higher-level languages, such as <b><a href="#LISP">LISP</a></b>, which employ a garbage
   collector (see <b><a href="#GC">GC</a></b>).  Also called a <b><a href="#stale%20pointer%20bug">stale pointer bug</a></b>.

   Algol-60 and FORTRAN communities in the 1960s.

<p><b>Alice and Bob</b> n. <p>
 The archetypal individuals used as
   examples in discussions of cryptographic protocols.  Originally,
   theorists would say something like: "A communicates with someone
   who claims to be B, So to be sure, A tests that B knows a secret
   number K. So A sends to B a random number X. B then forms Y by
   encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to A" Because this sort
   of thing is quite hard to follow, theorists stopped using the
   unadorned letters A and B to represent the main players and started
   calling them Alice and Bob. So now we say "Alice communicates with
   someone claiming to be Bob, and to be sure, Alice tests that Bob
   knows a secret number K. Alice sends to Bob a random number X. Bob
   then forms Y by encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to
   Alice".  A whole mythology rapidly grew up around the
   metasyntactic names; see
   <a href="http://www.conceptlabs.co.uk/extras/ZurichSeminarSpeech3.htm">http://www.conceptlabs.co.uk/extras/ZurichSeminarSpeech3.htm</a>.

<p>In Bruce Schneier's definitive introductory text "Applied
   Cryptography" (2nd ed., 1996, John Wiley &amp; Sons, ISBN
   0-471-11709-9) he introduces a table of dramatis personae headed by
   Alice and Bob.  Others include Carol (a participant in three- and
   four-party protocols), Dave (a participant in four-party
   protocols), Eve (an eavesdropper), Mallory (a malicious active
   attacker), Trent (a trusted arbitrator), Walter (a warden), Peggy
   (a prover) and Victor (a verifier).  These names for roles are
   either already standard or, given the wide popularity of the book,
   may be expected to quickly become so.

<p><b>all your base are belong to us</b> <p>
 A declaration of victory or
   superiority. The phrase stems from a 1991 adaptation of Toaplan's
   "Zero Wing" shoot-'em-up arcade game for the Sega Genesis game
   console. A brief introduction was added to the opening screen, and
   it has what many consider to be the worst Japanese-to-English
   translation in video game history. The introduction shows the
   bridge of a starship in chaos as a Borg-like figure named CATS
   materializes and says, "How are you gentlemen!!  All your base are
   belong to us." [sic] In 2001, this amusing mistranslation spread
   virally through the internet, bringing with it a slew of JPEGs and
   a movie of hacked photographs, each showing a street sign, store
   front, package label, etc. hacked to read "All your base are belong
   to us" or one of the other dopy lines from the game. When the
   phrase is used properly, the overall effect is both screamingly
   funny and somewhat chilling, reminiscent of the B movie "They
   Live".

<p>The original has been generalized to "All your X are belong to
   us", where X is filled in to connote a sinister takeover of some
   sort.  Thus, "When Joe signed up for his new job at Yoyodyne, he
   had to sign a draconian NDA. It basically said, `All your code are
   belong to us.'" Has many of the connotations of "Resistance is
   futile; you will be assimilated" (see <b><a href="#Borg">Borg</a></b>). Considered
   silly, and most likely to be used by the type of person that finds
   <b><a href="#Jeff%20K.">Jeff K.</a></b>  hilarious.

<p><b>alt</b> /awlt/ <p>
 1. n. The alt shift key on an IBM PC or
   <b><a href="#clone">clone</a></b> keyboard; see <b><a href="#bucky%20bits">bucky bits</a></b>, sense 2 (though typical
   PC usage does not simply set the 0200 bit).  2. n. The `option'
   key on a Macintosh; use of this term usually reveals that the
   speaker hacked PCs before coming to the Mac (see also <b><a href="#feature%20key">feature key</a></b>, which is sometimes <em>incorrectly</em> called `alt'). 
   3. n.,obs.  [PDP-10; often capitalized to ALT] Alternate name
   for the ASCII ESC character (ASCII 0011011), after the keycap
   labeling on some older terminals; also `altmode' (/awlt'mohd/). 
   This character was almost never pronounced `escape' on an ITS
   system, in <b><a href="#TECO">TECO</a></b>, or under TOPS-10 -- always alt, as in "Type
   alt alt to end a TECO command" or "alt-U onto the system" (for
   "log onto the [ITS] system").  This usage probably arose because
   alt is more convenient to say than `escape', especially when
   followed by another alt or a character (or another alt <em>and</em> a
   character, for that matter).  4. The <i>alt</i> hierarchy on Usenet,
   the tree of newsgroups created by users without a formal vote and
   approval procedure.  There is a myth, not entirely implausible,
   that <i>alt</i> is acronymic for "anarchists, lunatics, and
   terrorists"; but in fact it is simply short for "alternative".

<p><b>Amiga</b> n <p>
 A series of personal computer models originally
   sold by Commodore, based on 680x0 processors, custom support chips
   and an operating system that combined some of the best features of
   Macintosh and Unix with compatibility with neither.

<p>The Amiga was released just as the personal computing world
   standardized on IBM-PC clones. This prevented it from gaining
   serious market share, despite the fact that the first Amigas had a
   substantial technological lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead,
   it acquired a small but zealous population of enthusiastic hackers
   who dreamt of one day unseating the clones (see <b><a href="#Amiga%20Persecution%20Complex">Amiga Persecution Complex</a></b>).  The traits of this culture are both spoofed
   and illuminated in <a href="http://www.blazemonger.com/BM/">The BLAZE Humor Viewer</a>. The strength of the Amiga platform seeded a
   small industry of companies building software and hardware for the
   platform, especially in graphics and video applications (see
   <b><a href="#video%20toaster">video toaster</a></b>).

<p>Due to spectacular mismanagement, Commodore did hardly any R&amp;D,
   allowing the competition to close Amiga's technological lead. 
   After Commodore went bankrupt in 1994 the technology passed through
   several hands, none of whom did much with it.  However, the Amiga
   is still being produced in Europe under license and has a
   substantial number of fans, which will probably extend the
   platform's life considerably.

   and <b><a href="#rogue">rogue</a></b>, one of the large freely distributed
   Dungeons-and-Dragons-like simulation games, available for a wide
   range of machines and operating systems. The name is from Tolkien's
   Pits of Angband (compare <b><a href="#elder%20days">elder days</a></b>, <b><a href="#elvish">elvish</a></b>).  Has been
   described as "Moria on steroids"; but, unlike Moria, many aspects
   of the game are customizable.  This leads many hackers and would-be
   hackers into fooling with these instead of doing productive work. 
   There are many Angband variants, of which the most notorious is
   probably the rather whimsical Zangband. In this game, when a key
   that does not correspond to a command is pressed, the game will
   display "Type ? for help" 50% of the time.  The other 50% of the
   time, random error messages including "An error has occurred
   because an error of type 42 has occurred" and "Windows 95
   uninstalled successfully" will be displayed.  Zangband also allows
   the player to kill Santa Claus (who has some really good stuff, but
   also has a lot of friends), "Bull Gates", and Barney the Dinosaur
   (but be watchful; Barney has a nasty case of halitosis). There is

<p><b>ANSI</b> /an'see/ <p>
 1. n. [techspeak] The American National
   Standards Institute. ANSI, along with the International Organization
   for Standards (ISO), standardized the C programming language (see
   <b><a href="#K&amp;R">K&amp;R</a></b>, <b><a href="#Classic%20C">Classic C</a></b>), and promulgates many other important
   software standards.  2. n. [techspeak] A terminal may be said to be
   `ANSI' if it meets the ANSI X3.64 standard for terminal control. 
   Unfortunately, this standard was both over-complicated and too
   permissive.  It has been retired and replaced by the ECMA-48
   standard, which shares both flaws.  3. n. [BBS jargon] The set of
   screen-painting codes that most MS-DOS and Amiga computers accept. 
   This comes from the ANSI.SYS device driver that must be loaded on
   an MS-DOS computer to view such codes.  Unfortunately, neither DOS
   ANSI nor the BBS ANSIs derived from it exactly match the ANSI X3.64
   terminal standard.  For example, the ESC-[1m code turns on the bold
   highlight on large machines, but in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it turns on
   `intense' (bright) colors.  Also, in BBS-land, the term `ANSI' is
   often used to imply that a particular computer uses or can emulate
   the IBM high-half character set from MS-DOS.  Particular use
   depends on context. Occasionally, the vanilla ASCII character set
   is used with the color codes, but on BBSs, ANSI and `IBM
   characters' tend to go together.

 The ANSI standard usage
   of `ANSI standard' refers to any practice which is typical or broadly
   done.  It's most appropriately applied to things that everyone does that
   are not quite regulation.  For example: ANSI standard shaking of a
   laser printer cartridge to get extra life from it, or the ANSI
   standard word tripling in names of usenet alt groups.

<p><b>app</b> /ap/ n. <p>
 Short for `application program', as opposed
   to a systems program.  Apps are what systems vendors are forever
   chasing developers to create for their environments so they can
   sell more boxes.  Hackers tend not to think of the things they
   themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker parlance the term excludes
   compilers, program editors, games, and messaging systems, though a
   user would consider all those to be apps.  (Broadly, an app is
   often a self-contained environment for performing some well-defined
   task such as `word processing'; hackers tend to prefer more
   general-purpose tools.) See <b><a href="#killer%20app">killer app</a></b>; oppose <b><a href="#tool">tool</a></b>,

<p><b>ARMM</b> n. <p>
 [acronym, `Automated Retroactive Minimal
   Moderation'] A Usenet <b><a href="#cancelbot">cancelbot</a></b> created by Dick Depew of Munroe Falls,
   Ohio.  ARMM was intended to automatically cancel posts from
   anonymous-posting sites.  Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for
   anonymous postings triggered on its own automatically-generated
   control messages!  Transformed by this stroke of programming
   ineptitude into a monster of Frankensteinian proportions, it broke
   loose on the night of March 31, 1993 and proceeded to <b><a href="#spam">spam</a></b>
   <i>news.admin.policy</i> with a recursive explosion of over 200
   messages.

<p>ARMM's bug produced a recursive <b><a href="#cascade">cascade</a></b> of messages each of which
   mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and some other
   headers of its parent.  This produced a flood of messages in which
   each header took up several screens and each message ID and subject
   line got longer and longer and longer.

<p>Reactions varied from amusement to outrage.  The pathological
   messages crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying
   line charges for their Usenet feeds.  One poster described the ARMM
   debacle as "instant Usenet history" (also establishing the term
   <b><a href="#despew">despew</a></b>), and it has since been widely cited as a cautionary
   example of the havoc the combination of good intentions and
   incompetence can wreak on a network.  Compare <b><a href="#Great%20Worm">Great Worm</a></b>;

<p><b>asbestos cork award</b> n. <p>
 Once, long ago at MIT, there was a
   <b><a href="#flamer">flamer</a></b> so consistently obnoxious that another hacker designed,
   had made, and distributed posters announcing that said flamer had
   been nominated for the `asbestos cork award'.  (Any reader in

   etymology under <b><a href="#flame">flame</a></b>.)  Since then, it is agreed that only a
   select few have risen to the heights of bombast required to earn
   this dubious dignity -- but there is no agreement on <em>which</em>
   few.

<p><b>ASCII</b> /as'kee/ n. <p>
 [originally an acronym (American
   Standard Code for Information Interchange) but now merely
   conventional] The predominant character set encoding of present-day
   computers.  The standard version uses 7 bits for each character,
   whereas most earlier codes (including early drafts of ASCII
   prior to June 1961) used fewer.  This change allowed the inclusion
   of lowercase letters -- a major <b><a href="#win">win</a></b> -- but it did not
   provide for accented letters or any other letterforms not used in
   English (such as the German sharp-S
   or the ae-ligature
   which is a letter in, for example, Norwegian).  It could be worse,
   though.  It could be much worse.  See <b><a href="#EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a></b> to understand
   how.  A history of ASCII and its ancestors is at
   <a href="http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html">http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html</a>.

<p>Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than
   humans; thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about
   characters, and have developed a considerable amount of verbal
   shorthand for them.  Every character has one or more names -- some
   formal, some concise, some silly.  Common jargon names for ASCII
   characters are collected here.  See also individual entries for
   <b><a href="#bang">bang</a></b>, <b><a href="#excl">excl</a></b>, <b><a href="#open">open</a></b>, <b><a href="#ques">ques</a></b>, <b><a href="#semi">semi</a></b>, <b><a href="#shriek">shriek</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#splat">splat</a></b>, <b><a href="#twiddle">twiddle</a></b>, and <b><a href="#Yu-Shiang%20Whole%20Fish">Yu-Shiang Whole Fish</a></b>.

<p>This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII
   pronunciation guide.  Single characters are listed in ASCII order;
   character pairs are sorted in by first member.  For each character,
   common names are given in rough order of popularity, followed by
   names that are reported but rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names
   are surrounded by brokets: &lt;&gt;.  Square brackets mark the
   particularly silly names introduced by <b><a href="#INTERCAL">INTERCAL</a></b>.  The
   abbreviations "l/r" and "o/c" stand for left/right and
   "open/close" respectively.  Ordinary parentheticals provide some
   usage information.

<p>The pronunciation of <code>#</code> as `pound' is common in the U.S. 
   but a bad idea; <b><a href="#Commonwealth%20Hackish">Commonwealth Hackish</a></b> has its own, rather more
   apposite use of `pound sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards
   the pound graphic
   happens to replace <code>#</code>; thus Britishers sometimes call
   <code>#</code> on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard `pound', compounding the
   American error).  The U.S. usage derives from an old-fashioned
   commercial practice of using a <code>#</code> suffix to tag pound weights
   on bills of lading.  The character is usually pronounced `hash'
   outside the U.S.  There are more culture wars over the correct
   pronunciation of this character than any other, which has led to
   the <b><a href="#ha%20ha%20only%20serious">ha ha only serious</a></b> suggestion that it be pronounced
   `shibboleth' (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament or
   Tanakh).

<p>The `uparrow' name for circumflex and `leftarrow' name for
   underline are historical relics from archaic ASCII (the 1963
   version), which had these graphics in those character positions
   rather than the modern punctuation characters.

<p>The `swung dash' or `approximation' sign is not quite the same
   as tilde in typeset material
   but the ASCII tilde serves for both (compare <b><a href="#angle%20brackets">angle brackets</a></b>).

<p>Some other common usages cause odd overlaps.  The <code>#</code>,
   <code>$</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&amp;</code> characters, for example, are all
   pronounced "hex" in different communities because various
   assemblers use them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in
   particular, <code>#</code> in many assembler-programming cultures,
   <code>$</code> in the 6502 world, <code>&gt;</code> at Texas Instruments, and
   <code>&amp;</code> on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80 machines).  See
   also <b><a href="#splat">splat</a></b>.

<p>The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the
   world's other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits
   look more and more like a serious <b><a href="#misfeature">misfeature</a></b> as the use of
   international networks continues to increase (see <b><a href="#software%20rot">software rot</a></b>).  Hardware and software from the U.S. still tends to embody
   the assumption that ASCII is the universal character set and that
   characters have 7 bits; this is a major irritant to people who
   want to use a character set suited to their own languages. 
   Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem by proliferating
   `national' character sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use
   a <em>smaller</em> subset common to all those in use.

<p><b>ASCIIbetical order</b> /as'kee-be'-t*-kl or'dr/ adj.,n. <p>

<p>Used to indicate that data is sorted in ASCII collated order rather
   than alphabetical order.  This lexicon is sorted in something close
   to ASCIIbetical order, but with case ignored and entries beginning
   with non-alphabetic characters moved to the beginning.  "At my video
   store, they used their computer to sort the videos into
   ASCIIbetical order, so I couldn't find `"Crocodile" Dundee' until I
   thought to look before `2001' and `48 HRS.'!"

<p><b>astroturfing</b> n. <p>
 The use of paid shills to create the
   impression of a popular movement, through means like letters to
   newspapers from soi-disant `concerned citizens', paid opinion
   pieces, and the formation of grass-roots lobbying groups that are
   actually funded by a PR group (astroturf is fake grass; hence the
   term).  This term became common among hackers after it came to
   light in early 1998 that Microsoft had attempted to use such
   tactics to forestall the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust
   action against the company.

<p>This backfired horribly, angering a number of state
   attorneys-general enough to induce them to go public with plans to
   join the Federal suit.  It also set anybody defending Microsoft on
   the net for the accusation "You're just astroturfing!".

<p><b>atomic</b> adj. <p>
 [from Gk. `atomos', indivisible]
   1. Indivisible; cannot be split up.  For example, an instruction
   may be said to do several things `atomically', i.e., all the
   things are done immediately, and there is no chance of the
   instruction being half-completed or of another being interspersed. 
   Used esp. to convey that an operation cannot be screwed up by
   interrupts.  "This routine locks the file and increments the
   file's semaphore atomically."  2. [primarily techspeak] Guaranteed
   to complete successfully or not at all, usu. refers to database
   transactions.  If an error prevents a partially-performed
   transaction from proceeding to completion, it must be "backed out,"
   as the database must not be left in an inconsistent state.

<p>Computer usage, in either of the above senses, has none of the
   connotations that `atomic' has in mainstream English (i.e.  of
   particles of matter, nuclear explosions etc.).

<p><b>attoparsec</b> n. <p>
 About an inch.  `atto-' is the standard SI
   prefix for multiplication by 10^(-18).  A parsec
   (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years; an attoparsec is thus
   3.26 * 10^(-18) light years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1
   attoparsec/<b><a href="#microfortnight">microfortnight</a></b> equals about 1 inch/sec).  This unit
   is reported to be in use (though probably not very seriously) among
   hackers in the U.K.  See <b><a href="#micro-">micro-</a></b>.

<p><b>autoconfiscate</b> <p>
 [originally from Cygnus Solutions, later Red
   Hat Software] To set up or modify a source-code <b><a href="#distribution">distribution</a></b>
   so that it configures and builds using the GNU project's
   autoconf/automake/libtools suite.  Among open-source hackers, a
   mere running binary of a program is not considered a full release;
   what's interesting is a source tree that can be built into binaries
   using standard tools. Since the mid-1990s, autoconf and friends
   been the standard way to adapt a distribution for portability so
   that it casn be built on multiple operating systems without change.

<p><b>automagically</b> /aw-toh-maj'i-klee/ adv. <p>
 Automatically, but
   in a way that, for some reason (typically because it is too
   complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the speaker
   doesn't feel like explaining to you.  See <b><a href="#magic">magic</a></b>.  "The
   C-INTERCAL compiler generates C, then automagically invokes
   <code>cc(1)</code> to produce an executable."

<p>This term is quite old, going back at least to the mid-70s in
   jargon and probably much earlier.  The word `automagic' occurred in
   advertising (for a shirt-ironing gadget) as far back as the late
   1940s.

<p><b>avatar</b> n. Syn. <p>
 [in Hindu mythology, the incarnation of
   a god] 1. Among people working on virtual reality and
   <b><a href="#cyberspace">cyberspace</a></b> interfaces, an <dfn>avatar</dfn> is an icon or
   representation of a user in a shared virtual reality.  The term is
   sometimes used on <b><a href="#MUD">MUD</a></b>s.  2. [CMU, Tektronix] <b><a href="#root">root</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#superuser">superuser</a></b>.  There are quite a few Unix machines on which the
   name of the superuser account is `avatar' rather than `root'. 
   This quirk was originated by a CMU hacker who found the terms
   `root' and  `superuser' unimaginative, and thought `avatar'
   might better impress people with the responsibility they were
   accepting.

 1. n. [Unix techspeak] An interpreted language
   for massaging text data developed by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger,
   and Brian Kernighan (the name derives from their initials).  It is
   characterized by C-like syntax, a declaration-free approach to
   variable typing and declarations, associative arrays, and
   field-oriented text processing.  See also <b><a href="#Perl">Perl</a></b>.  2. n.

<p><b>back door</b> n. <p>
 [common] A hole in the security of a
   system deliberately left in place by designers or maintainers.  The
   motivation for such holes is not always sinister; some operating
   systems, for example, come out of the box with privileged accounts
   intended for use by field service technicians or the vendor's
   maintenance programmers.  Syn. <b><a href="#trap%20door">trap door</a></b>; may also be called a

   Ken Thompson's 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the
   existence of a back door in early Unix versions that may have
   qualified as the most fiendishly clever security hack of all time. 
   In this scheme, the C compiler contained code that would recognize
   when the `login' command was being recompiled and insert some
   code recognizing a password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to
   the system whether or not an account had been created for him.

<p>Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the
   source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler.  But to
   recompile the compiler, you have to <em>use</em> the compiler -- so
   Thompson also arranged that the compiler would <em>recognize when
   it was compiling a version of itself</em>, and insert into the
   recompiled compiler the code to insert into the recompiled
   `login' the code to allow Thompson entry -- and, of course, the
   code to recognize itself and do the whole thing again the next time
   around!  And having done this once, he was then able to recompile
   the compiler from the original sources; the hack perpetuated itself
   invisibly, leaving the back door in place and active but with no
   trace in the sources.

<p>The Turing lecture that suggested this truly moby hack was later
   published as "Reflections on Trusting Trust",
   "Communications of the ACM 27", 8 (August 1984), pp. 761-763
   (text available at <a href="http://www.acm.org/classics">http://www.acm.org/classics</a>).  Ken
   Thompson has since confirmed that this hack was implemented and
   that the Trojan Horse code did appear in the login binary of a Unix
   Support group machine.  Ken says the crocked compiler was never
   distributed.  Your editor has heard two separate reports that
   suggest that the crocked login did make it out of Bell Labs,
   notably to BBN, and that it enabled at least one late-night login
   across the network by someone using the login name `kt'.

 A group of large-site administrators who
   pushed through the <b><a href="#Great%20Renaming">Great Renaming</a></b> and reined in the chaos of
   <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b> during most of the 1980s.  During most of its lifetime,
   the Cabal (as it was sometimes capitalized) steadfastly denied its
   own existence; it was almost obligatory for anyone privy to their
   secrets to respond "There is no Cabal" whenever the existence or
   activities of the group were speculated on in public.

<p>The result of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery.  Even
   a decade after the cabal <b><a href="#mailing%20list">mailing list</a></b> disbanded in late 1988
   following a bitter internal catfight, many people believed (or
   claimed to believe) that it had not actually disbanded but only
   gone deeper underground with its power intact.

<p>This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about
   various Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking
   over the Usenet or Internet.  These paranoias were later satirized
   in ways that took on a life of their own.  See <b><a href="#Eric%20Conspiracy">Eric Conspiracy</a></b>

<p><b>background</b> n.,adj.,vt. <p>
 [common] To do a task `in
   background' is to do it whenever <b><a href="#foreground">foreground</a></b> matters are not
   claiming your undivided attention, and `to background' something
   means to relegate it to a lower priority.  "For now, we'll just
   print a list of nodes and links; I'm working on the graph-printing
   problem in background."  Note that this implies ongoing activity
   but at a reduced level or in spare time, in contrast to mainstream
   `back burner' (which connotes benign neglect until some future
   resumption of activity).  Some people prefer to use the term for
   processing that they have queued up for their unconscious minds (a
   tack that one can often fruitfully take upon encountering an
   obstacle in creative work).  Compare <b><a href="#amp%20off">amp off</a></b>, <b><a href="#slopsucker">slopsucker</a></b>.

<p>Technically, a task running in background is detached from the
   terminal where it was started (and often running at a lower
   priority); oppose <b><a href="#foreground">foreground</a></b>.  Nowadays this term is primarily
   associated with <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b>, but it appears to have been first used

 [Durham, UK] Said of something that
   is both badly designed and wrongly executed. This common term is
   the prototype of, and is used by contrast with, three less common
   terms - Bad and Right (a kludge, something ugly but functional);
   Good and Wrong (an overblown GUI or other attractive nuisance); and
   (rare praise) Good and Right.  These terms entered common use at
   Durham c.1994 and may have been imported from elsewhere; they are
   also in use at Oxford, and the emphatic form "Evil and Bad and
   Wrong" (abbreviated EBW) is reported from there.  There are
   standard abbreviations: they start with B&amp;R, a typo for "Bad and
   Wrong".  Consequently, B&amp;W is actually "Bad and Right", G&amp;R =
   "Good and Wrong", and G&amp;W = "Good and Right". Compare

<p><b>baggy pantsing</b> v. <p>
 [Georgia Tech] A "baggy pantsing" is
   used to reprimand hackers who incautiously leave their terminals
   unlocked.  The affected user will come back to find a post from
   them on internal newsgroups discussing exactly how baggy their
   pants are, an accepted stand-in for "unattentive user who left
   their work unprotected in the clusters". A properly-done baggy
   pantsing is highly mocking and humorous.  It is considered bad form
   to post a baggy pantsing to off-campus newsgroups or the more
   technical, serious groups.  A particularly nice baggy pantsing may
   be "claimed" by immediately quoting the message in full, followed
   by your sig; this has the added benefit of keeping the embarassed
   victim from being able to delete the post.  Interesting
   baggy-pantsings have been done involving adding commands to login
   scripts to repost the message every time the unlucky user logs in;
   Unix boxes on the residential network, when cracked, oftentimes
   have their homepages replaced (after being politely backedup to
   another file) with a baggy-pants message; .plan files are also
   occasionally targeted. Usage: "Prof. Greenlee fell asleep in the
   Solaris cluster again; we baggy-pantsed him to
   git.cc.class.2430.flame."  Compare <b><a href="#derf">derf</a></b>.

   <b><a href="#hop">hop</a></b> is signified by a <b><a href="#bang">bang</a></b> sign.  Thus, for example, the
   path <i>...!bigsite!foovax!barbox!me</i> directs people to route their
   mail to machine <i>bigsite</i> (presumably a well-known location
   accessible to everybody) and from there through the machine
   <i>foovax</i> to the account of user <i>me</i> on <i>barbox</i>.

<p>In the bad old days of not so long ago, before autorouting mailers
   became commonplace, people often published compound bang addresses
   using the { } convention (see <b><a href="#glob">glob</a></b>) to give paths from
   <em>several</em> big machines, in the hopes that one's correspondent
   might be able to get mail to one of them reliably (example:
   <i>...!{seismo, ut-sally, ihnp4}!rice!beta!gamma!me</i>).  Bang paths
   of 8 to 10 hops were not uncommon in 1981.  Late-night dial-up
   UUCP links would cause week-long transmission times.  Bang paths
   were often selected by both transmission time and reliability, as
   messages would often get lost.  See <b><a href="#Internet%20address">Internet address</a></b>,

   print spoolers (see <b><a href="#spool">spool</a></b>).  Typically includes user or
   account ID information in very large character-graphics capitals. 
   Also called a `burst page', because it indicates where to burst
   (tear apart) fanfold paper to separate one user's printout from the
   next.  2. A similar printout generated (typically on multiple pages
   of fan-fold paper) from user-specified text, e.g., by a program
   such as Unix's <code>banner({1,6})</code>.  3. On interactive software,
   a first screen containing a logo and/or author credits and/or a

<p><b>bare metal</b> n. <p>
 1. [common] New computer hardware,
   unadorned with such snares and delusions as an <b><a href="#operating%20system">operating system</a></b>, an <b><a href="#HLL">HLL</a></b>, or even assembler.  Commonly used in the
   phrase `programming on the bare metal', which refers to the
   arduous work of <b><a href="#bit%20bashing">bit bashing</a></b> needed to create these basic tools
   for a new machine.  Real bare-metal programming involves things
   like building boot proms and BIOS chips, implementing basic
   monitors used to test device drivers, and writing the assemblers
   that will be used to write the compiler back ends that will give
   the new machine a real development environment.  2. `Programming on
   the bare metal' is also used to describe a style of
   <b><a href="#hand-hacking">hand-hacking</a></b> that relies on bit-level peculiarities of a
   particular hardware design, esp. tricks for speed and space
   optimization that rely on crocks such as overlapping instructions
   (or, as in the famous case described in <b><a href="#The%20Story%20of%20Mel">The Story of Mel</a></b> (in
   Appendix A), interleaving of opcodes on a magnetic drum to minimize
   fetch delays due to the device's rotational latency).  This sort of
   thing has become less common as the relative costs of programming
   time and machine resources have changed, but is still found in
   heavily constrained environments such as industrial embedded
   systems, and in the code of hackers who just can't let go of that
   low-level control.  See <b><a href="#Real%20Programmer">Real Programmer</a></b>.

<p>In the world of personal computing, bare metal programming
   (especially in sense 1 but sometimes also in sense 2) is often
   considered a <b><a href="#Good%20Thing">Good Thing</a></b>, or at least a necessary evil
   (because these machines have often been sufficiently slow and
   poorly designed to make it necessary; see <b><a href="#ill-behaved">ill-behaved</a></b>). 
   There, the term usually refers to bypassing the BIOS or OS
   interface and writing the application to directly access device
   registers and machine addresses.  "To get 19.2 kilobaud on the
   serial port, you need to get down to the bare metal."  People who
   can do this sort of thing well are held in high regard.

<p><b>barf</b> /barf/ n.,v. <p>
 [common; from mainstream slang

   you try to divide by 0."  (That is, the division operation checks
   for an attempt to divide by zero, and if one is encountered it
   causes the operation to fail in some unspecified, but generally

   "Why is /var/adm taking up so much space?"  "The logs have grown
   to several barns."  The source of this is clear: when physicists
   were first studying nuclear interactions, the probability was
   thought to be proportional to the cross-sectional area of the
   nucleus (this probability is still called the cross-section).  Upon
   experimenting, they discovered the interactions were far more
   probable than expected; the nuclei were `as big as a barn'.  The
   units for cross-sections were christened Barns, (10^-24 cm^2) and

<p><b>BASIC</b> /bay'-sic/ n. <p>
 A programming language,
   originally designed for Dartmouth's experimental timesharing system
   in the early 1960s, which for many years was the leading cause of
   brain damage in proto-hackers.  Edsger W. Dijkstra observed in
   "Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective" that
   "It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to
   students that have had prior exposure to BASIC: as potential
   programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of
   regeneration."  This is another case (like <b><a href="#Pascal">Pascal</a></b>) of the
   cascading <b><a href="#lossage">lossage</a></b> that happens when a language deliberately
   designed as an educational toy gets taken too seriously.  A novice
   can write short BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very
   easily; writing anything longer (a) is very painful, and (b)
   encourages bad habits that will make it harder to use more powerful
   languages well.  This wouldn't be so bad if historical accidents
   hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros in the 1980s.  As it
   is, it probably ruined tens of thousands of potential wizards.

<p>[1995: Some languages called `BASIC' aren't quite this nasty any
   more, having acquired Pascal- and C-like procedures and control
   structures and shed their line numbers. --ESR]

<p>BASIC stands for "Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction
   Code".  Earlier versions of this entry claiming this was a

<p><b>batbelt</b> n. <p>
 Many hackers routinely hang numerous devices
   such as pagers, cell-phones, personal organizers, leatherman
   multitools, pocket knives, flashlights, walkie-talkies, even
   miniature computers from their belts. When many of these devices
   are worn at once, the hacker's belt somewhat resembles Batman's
   utility belt; hence it is referred to as a batbelt.

<p><b>batch</b> adj. <p>
 1. Non-interactive.  Hackers use this somewhat
   more loosely than the traditional technical definitions justify; in
   particular, switches on a normally interactive program that prepare
   it to receive non-interactive command input are often referred to
   as `batch mode' switches.  A `batch file' is a series of
   instructions written to be handed to an interactive program running
   in batch mode.  2. Performance of dreary tasks all at one sitting. 
   "I finally sat down in batch mode and wrote out checks for all
   those bills; I guess they'll turn the electricity back on next
   week<small>...</small>" 3. `batching up': Accumulation of a number of small
   tasks that can be lumped together for greater efficiency.  "I'm

<p><b>Batman factor</b> n. <p>
 1. An integer number representing the
   number of items hanging from a <b><a href="#batbelt">batbelt</a></b>. In most settings, a
   Batman factor of more than 3 is not acceptable without odd stares
   and whispering. This encourages the hacker in question to choose
   items for the batbelt carefully to avoid awkward social situations,
   usually amongst non-hackers.  2. A somewhat more vaguely defined
   index of contribution to sense 1.  Devices that are especially
   obtrusive, such as large, older model cell phones, "Pocket" PC
   devices and walkie talkies are said to have a high batman
   factor. Sleeker devices such as a later-model Palm or StarTac phone
   are prized for their low batman factor and lessened obtrusiveness
   and weight.

<p><b>baud</b> /bawd/ n. <p>
 [simplified from its technical meaning]
   n. Bits per second.  Hence kilobaud or Kbaud, thousands of bits per
   second.  The technical meaning is `level transitions per
   second'; this coincides with bps only for two-level modulation with
   no framing or stop bits.  Most hackers are aware of these nuances
   but blithely ignore them.

<p>Historical note: `baud' was originally a unit of telegraph
   signalling speed, set at one pulse per second.  It was proposed at
   the November, 1926 conference of the Comit&eacute; Consultatif
   International Des Communications T&eacute;l&eacute;graphiques as an
   improvement on the then standard practice of referring to line
   speeds in terms of words per minute, and named for Jean Maurice
   Emile Baudot (1845-1903), a French engineer who did a lot
   of pioneering work in early teleprinters.

 In 1997, after meditating on the success

   wrote an analytical paper on hacker culture and development models
   titled <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>.  The main argument of the paper was
   that <b><a href="#Brooks's%20Law">Brooks's Law</a></b> is not the whole story; given the right

   language in which the original <b><a href="#hello%20world">hello world</a></b> program was
   written. It has been ported to so many different systems that its
   creator confesses to having lost count. It has only one data type
   (a machine word) which can be used as an integer, a character, a
   floating point number, a pointer, or almost anything else,
   depending on context.  BCPL was a precursor of C, which inherited
   some of its features.

<p><b>beta</b> /bay't*/, /be't*/ or (Commonwealth) /bee't*/ n. 
   <p>
 1. Mostly working, but still under test; usu. used with `in':
   `in beta'.  In the <b><a href="#Real%20World">Real World</a></b>, hardware or software systems
   often go through two stages of release testing: Alpha (in-house)
   and Beta (out-house?).  Beta releases are generally made to a group
   of lucky (or unlucky) trusted customers.  2. Anything that is new
   and experimental.  "His girlfriend is in beta" means that he is
   still testing for compatibility and reserving judgment.  3. Flaky;
   dubious; suspect (since beta software is notoriously buggy).

<p>Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a
   pre-release (potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software
   by making it available to selected (or self-selected) customers and
   users.  This term derives from early 1960s terminology for product
   cycle checkpoints, first used at IBM but later standard throughout
   the industry.  `Alpha Test' was the unit, module, or component test
   phase; `Beta Test' was initial system test.  These themselves came
   from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware.  The A-test was a
   feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any
   commitment to design and development.  The B-test was a
   demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified. 
   The C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed
   on early samples of the production design, and the D test was the C
   test repeated after the model had been in production a while.

 [common; From Swift's "Gulliver's
   Travels" via the famous paper "On Holy Wars and a Plea for
   Peace" by Danny Cohen, USC/ISI IEN 137, dated April 1, 1980]
   1. Describes a computer architecture in which, within a given
   multi-byte numeric representation, the most significant byte has
   the lowest address (the word is stored `big-end-first').  Most
   processors, including the IBM 370 family, the <b><a href="#PDP-10">PDP-10</a></b>, the
   Motorola microprocessor families, and most of the various RISC
   designs are big-endian.  Big-endian byte order is also sometimes
   called `network order'. See <b><a href="#little-endian">little-endian</a></b>,

   it the other way round before the Internet domain standard was
   established.  Most gateway sites have <b><a href="#ad-hockery">ad-hockery</a></b> in their
   mailers to handle this, but can still be confused.  In particular,
   the address <i>me@uk.ac.bris.pys.as</i> could be interpreted in
   JANET's big-endian way as one in the U.K. (domain <i>uk</i>) or in the
   standard little-endian way as one in the domain <i>as</i> (American
   Samoa) on the opposite side of the world.

<p><b>bignum</b> /big'nuhm/ n. <p>
 [common; orig. from MIT MacLISP]
   1. [techspeak] A multiple-precision computer representation for
   very large integers.  2. More generally, any very large number. 
   "Have you ever looked at the United States Budget?  There's
   bignums for you!"  3. [Stanford] In backgammon, large numbers on
   the dice especially a roll of double fives or double sixes (compare
   <b><a href="#moby">moby</a></b>, sense 4).  See also <b><a href="#El%20Camino%20Bignum">El Camino Bignum</a></b>.

<p>Sense 1 may require some explanation.  Most computer languages
   provide a kind of data called `integer', but such computer
   integers are usually very limited in size; usually they must be
   smaller than 2^(31) (2,147,483,648) or (on a
   <b><a href="#bitty%20box">bitty box</a></b>) 2^(15) (32,768).  If you want to work
   with numbers larger than that, you have to use floating-point
   numbers, which are usually accurate to only six or seven decimal
   places.  Computer languages that provide bignums can perform exact
   calculations on very large numbers, such as 1000! (the factorial
   of 1000, which is 1000 times 999 times 998 times <small>...</small> times 2
   times 1).  For example, this value for 1000!  was computed by the
   MacLISP system using bignums:

   thus, `Cray bigot', `ITS bigot', `APL bigot', `VMS bigot',

<p><b>bit</b> n. <p>
 [from the mainstream meaning and `Binary digIT']
   1. [techspeak] The unit of information; the amount of information
   obtained by asking a yes-or-no question for which the two outcomes
   are equally probable.  2. [techspeak] A computational quantity that
   can take on one of two values, such as true and false or 0 and 1. 
   3. A mental flag: a reminder that something should be done
   eventually.  "I have a bit set for you."  (I haven't seen you for
   a while, and I'm supposed to tell or ask you something.)  4. More
   generally, a (possibly incorrect) mental state of belief.  "I have
   a bit set that says that you were the last guy to hack on EMACS." 
   (Meaning "I think you were the last guy to hack on EMACS, and what
   I am about to say is predicated on this, so please stop me if this
   isn't true.")

<p>"I just need one bit from you" is a polite way of indicating that
   you intend only a short interruption for a question that can
   presumably be answered yes or no.

<p>A bit is said to be `set' if its value is true or 1, and
   `reset' or `clear' if its value is false or 0.  One speaks of
   setting and clearing bits.  To <b><a href="#toggle">toggle</a></b> or `invert' a bit is
   to change it, either from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.  See also
   <b><a href="#flag">flag</a></b>, <b><a href="#trit">trit</a></b>, <b><a href="#mode%20bit">mode bit</a></b>.

<p>The term `bit' first appeared in print in the computer-science
   sense in a 1948 paper by information theorist Claude Shannon, and
   was there credited to the early computer scientist John Tukey (who
   also seems to have coined the term `software').  Tukey records
   that `bit' evolved over a lunch table as a handier alternative to
   `bigit' or `binit', at a conference in the winter of 1943-44.

<p><b>bit bang</b> n. <p>
 Transmission of data on a serial line, when
   accomplished by rapidly tweaking a single output bit, in software,
   at the appropriate times.  The technique is a simple loop with
   eight OUT and SHIFT instruction pairs for each byte.  Input is more
   interesting.  And full duplex (doing input and output at the same
   time) is one way to separate the real hackers from the
   <b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b>s.

<p>Bit bang was used on certain early models of Prime computers,
   presumably when UARTs were too expensive, and on archaic Z80 micros
   with a Zilog PIO but no SIO.  In an interesting instance of the
   <b><a href="#cycle%20of%20reincarnation">cycle of reincarnation</a></b>, this technique returned to use in the
   early 1990s on some RISC architectures because it consumes such
   an infinitesimal part of the processor that it actually makes sense
   not to have a UART.  Compare <b><a href="#cycle%20of%20reincarnation">cycle of reincarnation</a></b>.

<p><b>bit bucket</b> n. <p>
 [very common] 1. The universal data sink
   (originally, the mythical receptacle used to catch bits when they
   fall off the end of a register during a shift instruction). 
   Discarded, lost, or destroyed data is said to have `gone to the
   bit bucket'.  On <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b>, often used for <b><a href="#%2fdev%2fnull">/dev/null</a></b>. 
   Sometimes amplified as `the Great Bit Bucket in the Sky'.  2. The
   place where all lost mail and news messages eventually go.  The
   selection is performed according to <b><a href="#Finagle's%20Law">Finagle's Law</a></b>; important
   mail is much more likely to end up in the bit bucket than junk
   mail, which has an almost 100% probability of getting delivered. 
   Routing to the bit bucket is automatically performed by
   mail-transfer agents, news systems, and the lower layers of the
   network.  3. The ideal location for all unwanted mail responses:
   "Flames about this article to the bit bucket."  Such a request is
   guaranteed to overflow one's mailbox with flames.  4. Excuse for
   all mail that has not been sent.  "I mailed you those figures last
   week; they must have landed in the bit bucket."  Compare <b><a href="#black%20hole">black hole</a></b>.

<p>This term is used purely in jest.  It is based on the fanciful
   notion that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only
   misplaced.  This appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term
   `bit box', about which the same legend was current; old-time
   hackers also report that trainees used to be told that when the CPU
   stored bits into memory it was actually pulling them `out of the
   bit box'.  See also <b><a href="#chad%20box">chad box</a></b>.

<p>Another variant of this legend has it that, as a consequence of the
   `parity preservation law', the number of 1 bits that go to the bit
   bucket must equal the number of 0 bits.  Any imbalance results in
   bits filling up the bit bucket.  A qualified computer technician
   can empty a full bit bucket as part of scheduled maintenance.

<p><b>bit rot</b> n. <p>
 [common] Also <b><a href="#bit%20decay">bit decay</a></b>.  Hypothetical
   disease the existence of which has been deduced from the
   observation that unused programs or features will often stop
   working after sufficient time has passed, even if `nothing has
   changed'.  The theory explains that bits decay as if they were
   radioactive.  As time passes, the contents of a file or the code in
   a program will become increasingly garbled.

<p>There actually are physical processes that produce such effects
   (alpha particles generated by trace radionuclides in ceramic chip
   packages, for example, can change the contents of a computer memory
   unpredictably, and various kinds of subtle media failures can
   corrupt files in mass storage), but they are quite rare (and
   computers are built with error-detecting circuitry to compensate
   for them).  The notion long favored among hackers that cosmic
   rays are among the causes of such events turns out to be a myth;
   see the <b><a href="#cosmic%20rays">cosmic rays</a></b> entry for details.

<p>The term <b><a href="#software%20rot">software rot</a></b> is almost synonymous.  Software rot is
   the effect, bit rot the notional cause.

<p><b>bit-paired keyboard</b> n.,obs. <p>
 (alt. `bit-shift
   keyboard') A non-standard keyboard layout that seems to have
   originated with the Teletype ASR-33 and remained common for several
   years on early computer equipment.  The ASR-33 was a mechanical
   device (see <b><a href="#EOU">EOU</a></b>), so the only way to generate the character
   codes from keystrokes was by some physical linkage.  The design of
   the ASR-33 assigned each character key a basic pattern that could
   be modified by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was
   pressed.  In order to avoid making the thing even more of a kluge
   than it already was, the design had to group characters that shared
   the same basic bit pattern on one key.

<p>Looking at the ASCII chart, we find:

<pre>high  low bits
bits  0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001
 010        !    "    #    $    %    &amp;    '    (    )
 011   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
</pre>

<p>This is why the characters !"#$%&amp;'() appear where they do on a
   Teletype (thankfully, they didn't use shift-0 for space). The
   Teletype Model 33 was actually designed before ASCII existed, and
   was originally intended to use a code that contained these two
   rows:

<pre>      low bits
high  0000  0010  0100  0110  1000  1010  1100  1110
bits     0001  0011  0101  0111  1001  1011  1101  1111
  10   )  ! bel #  $  % wru &amp;  *  (  "  :  ?  _  ,   .
  11   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  '  ;  /  - esc del
</pre>

<p>The result would have been something closer to a normal keyboard.  But
   as it happened, Teletype had to use a lot of persuasion just to keep
   ASCII, and the Model 33 keyboard, from looking like this instead:

<pre>          !  "  ?  $  '  &amp;  -  (  )  ;  :  *  /  ,  .
       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  +  ~  &lt;  &gt;    |
</pre>

<p>Teletype's was <em>not</em> the weirdest variant of the <b><a href="#QWERTY">QWERTY</a></b> layout
   widely seen, by the way; that prize should probably go to one of
   several (differing) arrangements on IBM's even clunkier 026 and 029
   card punches.

<p>When electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there
   was no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be
   laid out.  Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard,
   while others used the flexibility of electronic circuitry to make
   their product look like an office typewriter.  Either choice was
   supported by the ANSI computer keyboard standard, X4.14-1971, which
   referred to the alternatives as `logical bit pairing' and
   `typewriter pairing'. These alternatives became known as
   `bit-paired' and `typewriter-paired' keyboards.  To a hacker,
   the bit-paired keyboard seemed far more logical -- and because
   most hackers in those days had never learned to touch-type, there
   was little pressure from the pioneering users to adapt keyboards to
   the typewriter standard.

<p>The doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale
   introduction of the computer terminal into the normal office
   environment, where out-and-out technophobes were expected to use
   the equipment.  The `typewriter-paired' standard became
   universal, X4.14 was superseded by X4.23-1982, `bit-paired'
   hardware was quickly junked or relegated to dusty corners, and both
   terms passed into disuse.

<p>However, in countries without a long history of touch typing, the
   argument against the bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or
   nonexistent. As a result, the standard Japanese keyboard, used on
   PCs, Unix boxen etc. still has all of the !"#$%&amp;'() characters
   above the numbers in the ASR-33 layout.

<p><b>blinkenlights</b> /blink'*n-li:tz/ n. <p>
 [common] Front-panel
   diagnostic lights on a computer, esp. a <b><a href="#dinosaur">dinosaur</a></b>.  Now that
   dinosaurs are rare, this term usually refers to status lights on a
   modem, network hub, or the like.

<p>This term derives from the last word of the famous
   blackletter-Gothic sign in mangled pseudo-German that once graced
   about half the computer rooms in the English-speaking world.  One
   version ran in its entirety as follows:

<br><p>
<p align="center">ACHTUNG!  ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS!</p>

<blockquote>
Das computermachine ist nicht fuer gefingerpoken und mittengrabben. 
Ist easy schnappen der springenwerk, blowenfusen und poppencorken
mit spitzensparken.  Ist nicht fuer gewerken bei das dumpkopfen. 
Das rubbernecken sichtseeren keepen das cotten-pickenen hans in das
pockets muss; relaxen und watchen das blinkenlichten. 
</blockquote>


<br><p>
<p>This silliness dates back at least as far as 1959 at Stanford
   University and had already gone international by the early 1960s,
   when it was reported at London University's ATLAS computing site. 
   There are several variants of it in circulation, some of which
   actually do end with the word `blinkenlights'.

<p>In an amusing example of turnabout-is-fair-play, German hackers
   have developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster in
   fractured English, one of which is reproduced here:

<br><p>
<p align="center">ATTENTION</p>

<blockquote>
This room is fullfilled mit special electronische equippment. 
Fingergrabbing and pressing the cnoeppkes from the computers is
allowed for die experts only!  So all the "lefthanders" stay away
and do not disturben the brainstorming von here working
intelligencies.  Otherwise you will be out thrown and kicked
anderswhere!  Also: please keep still and only watchen astaunished
the blinkenlights. 
</blockquote>


<br><p>
<p>See also <b><a href="#geef">geef</a></b>.

<p>Old-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for blinkenlights because
   they were so much more fun to look at than a blank panel.  Sadly,
   very few computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard
   certainly don't count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost
   of front-panel cutouts, almost nobody needs or wants to interpret
   machine-register states on the fly anymore) are only part of the
   story.  Another part of it is that radio-frequency leakage from the
   lamp wiring was beginning to be a problem as far back as transistor
   machines.  But the most fundamental fact is that there are very few
   signals slow enough to blink an LED these days!  With slow CPUs,
   you could watch the bus register or instruction counter tick, but
   at 33/66/150MHz it's all a blur.

<p>Despite this, a couple of relatively recent computer designs of
   note have featured programmable blinkenlights that were added just
   because they looked cool.  The Connection Machine, a
   65,536-processor parallel computer designed in the mid-1980s, was a
   black cube with one side covered with a grid of red blinkenlights;
   the sales demo had them evolving <b><a href="#life">life</a></b> patterns.  A few years
   later the ill-fated BeBox (a personal computer designed to run the
   BeOS operating system) featured twin rows of blinkenlights on the
   case front. When Be, Inc. decided to get out of the hardware
   business in 1996 and instead ported their OS to the PowerPC and
   later to the Intel architecture, many users severly suffered from
   the absence of their beloved blinkenlights.  Before long an
   external version of the blinkenlights driven by a PC serial port
   became available; there is some sort of plot symmetry in the fact
   that it was assembled by a German.

<p>Finally, a version updated for the Internet has been seen on
<i>news.admin.net-abuse.email</i>:

<br><p>
<p align="center">ACHTUNG! ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS!</p>

<blockquote>
Das Internet is nicht fuer gefingerclicken und giffengrabben. Ist easy
droppenpacket der routers und overloaden der backbone mit der spammen
und der me-tooen.  Ist nicht fuer gewerken bei das dumpkopfen. Das
mausklicken sichtseeren keepen das bandwit-spewin hans in das pockets
muss; relaxen und watchen das cursorblinken. 
</blockquote>

<p>This newest version partly reflects reports that the word
   `blinkenlights' is (in 1999) undergoing something of a revival in
   usage, but applied to networking equipment. The transmit and
   receive lights on routers, activity lights on switches and hubs,
   and other network equipment often blink in visually pleasing and
   seemingly coordinated ways. Although this is different in some ways
   from register readings, a tall stack of Cisco equipment or a
   19-inch rack of ISDN terminals can provoke a similar feeling of
   hypnotic awe, especially in a darkened network operations center or
   server room.

<p><b>blow an EPROM</b> /bloh *n ee'prom/ v. <p>
 (alt. `blast an
   EPROM', `burn an EPROM') To program a read-only memory, e.g. 
   for use with an embedded system.  This term arose because the
   programming process for the Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs)
   that preceded present-day Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memories
   (EPROMs) involved intentionally blowing tiny electrical fuses on
   the chip.  The usage lives on (it's too vivid and expressive to
   discard) even though the write process on EPROMs is nondestructive.

<p><b>blue box</b> <p>
 n. 1. obs. Once upon a time, before all-digital
   switches made it possible for the phone companies to move them out
   of band, one could actually hear the switching tones used to route
   long-distance calls.  Early <b><a href="#phreaker">phreaker</a></b>s built devices called
   `blue boxes' that could reproduce these tones, which could be
   used to commandeer portions of the phone network.  (This was not as
   hard as it may sound; one early phreak acquired the sobriquet
   `Captain Crunch' after he proved that he could generate switching
   tones with a plastic whistle pulled out of a box of Captain Crunch
   cereal!) There were other colors of box with more specialized
   phreaking uses; red boxes, black boxes, silver boxes, etc.  There
   were boxes of
   <a href="http://www.ElfQrin.com/docs/hakref/phrkbox/phreakboxes.html">other colors</a> as well, but the blue box was the original and

<p><b>BNF</b> /B-N-F/ n. <p>
 1. [techspeak] Acronym for `Backus
   Normal Form' (later retronymed to `Backus-Naur Form' because BNF
   was not in fact a normal form), a metasyntactic notation used to
   specify the syntax of programming languages, command sets, and the
   like.  Widely used for language descriptions but seldom documented
   anywhere, so that it must usually be learned by osmosis from other
   hackers.  Consider this BNF for a U.S. postal address:

<pre> &lt;postal-address&gt; ::= &lt;name-part&gt; &lt;street-address&gt; &lt;zip-part&gt;

 &lt;personal-part&gt; ::= &lt;name&gt; | &lt;initial&gt; "."

 &lt;name-part&gt; ::= &lt;personal-part&gt; &lt;last-name&gt; [&lt;jr-part&gt;] &lt;EOL&gt;
               | &lt;personal-part&gt; &lt;name-part&gt;

 &lt;street-address&gt; ::= [&lt;apt&gt;] &lt;house-num&gt; &lt;street-name&gt; &lt;EOL&gt;

 &lt;zip-part&gt; ::= &lt;town-name&gt; "," &lt;state-code&gt; &lt;ZIP-code&gt; &lt;EOL&gt;
</pre>

<p>This translates into English as: "A postal-address consists of a
   name-part, followed by a street-address part, followed by a
   zip-code part.  A personal-part consists of either a first name or
   an initial followed by a dot.  A name-part consists of either: a
   personal-part followed by a last name followed by an optional
   `jr-part' (Jr., Sr., or dynastic number) and end-of-line, or a
   personal part followed by a name part (this rule illustrates the
   use of recursion in BNFs, covering the case of people who use
   multiple first and middle names and/or initials).  A street address
   consists of an optional apartment specifier, followed by a street
   number, followed by a street name.  A zip-part consists of a
   town-name, followed by a comma, followed by a state code, followed
   by a ZIP-code followed by an end-of-line."  Note that many things
   (such as the format of a personal-part, apartment specifier, or
   ZIP-code) are left unspecified.  These are presumed to be obvious
   from context or detailed somewhere nearby.  See also <b><a href="#parse">parse</a></b>. 
   2. Any of a number of variants and extensions of BNF proper,
   possibly containing some or all of the <b><a href="#regexp">regexp</a></b> wildcards such
   as <code>*</code> or <code>+</code>.  In fact the example above isn't the pure
   form invented for the Algol-60 report; it uses <code>[]</code>, which was
   introduced a few years later in IBM's PL/I definition but is now
   universally recognized.  3. In <b><a href="#science-fiction%20fandom">science-fiction fandom</a></b>, a
   `Big-Name Fan' (someone famous or notorious).  Years ago a fan
   started handing out black-on-green BNF buttons at SF conventions;
   this confused the hacker contingent terribly.

<p><b>bob</b> n. <p>
 At <a href="http://www.demon.net/">Demon Internet</a>,
   all tech support personnel are called "Bob".  (Female support
   personnel have an option on "Bobette").  This has nothing to do
   with Bob the divine drilling-equipment salesman of the <b><a href="#Church%20of%20the%20SubGenius">Church of the SubGenius</a></b>.  Nor is it acronymized from "Brother Of
   <b><a href="#BOFH">BOFH</a></b>", though all parties agree it could have been.  Rather,
   it was triggered by an unusually large draft of new tech-support
   people in 1995.  It was observed that there would be much
   duplication of names.  To ease the confusion, it was decided that
   all support techs would henceforth be known as "Bob", and identity
   badges were created labelled "Bob 1" and "Bob 2".  ("No, we
   never got any further" reports a witness).

<p>The reason for "Bob" rather than anything else is due to a
   <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b> calling and asking to speak to "Bob", despite the fact
   that no "Bob" was currently working for Tech Support.  Since we
   all know "the customer is always right", it was decided that
   there had to be at least one "Bob" on duty at all times, just in
   case.

<p>This sillyness inexorably snowballed.  Shift leaders and managers
   began to refer to their groups of "bobs".  Whole ranks of support
   machines were set up (and still exist in the DNS as of 1999) as
   bob1 through bobN. Then came <i>alt.tech-support.recovery</i>, and
   it was filled with Demon support personnel.  They
   all referred to themselves, and to others, as `bob', and after a while it
   caught on.   There is now a
   <a href="http://bob.bob.bofh.org/~giolla/bobcode.html">Bob Code</a>

<p><b>bogo-sort</b> /boh`goh-sort'/ n. <p>
 (var. `stupid-sort')
   The archetypical perversely awful algorithm (as opposed to
   <b><a href="#bubble%20sort">bubble sort</a></b>, which is merely the generic <em>bad</em>
   algorithm).  Bogo-sort is equivalent to repeatedly throwing a deck
   of cards in the air, picking them up at random, and then testing
   whether they are in order.  It serves as a sort of canonical
   example of awfulness.  Looking at a program and seeing a dumb
   algorithm, one might say "Oh, I see, this program uses
   bogo-sort."  Esp.  appropriate for algorithms with factorial or
   super-exponential running time in the average case and
   probabilistically infinite worst-case running time.  Compare
   <b><a href="#bogus">bogus</a></b>, <b><a href="#brute%20force">brute force</a></b>, <b><a href="#lasherism">lasherism</a></b>.

<p>A spectacular variant of bogo-sort has been proposed which has the
   interesting property that, if the Many Worlds interpretation of
   quantum mechanics is true, it can sort an arbitrarily large array
   in linear time.  (In the Many-Worlds model, the result of any
   quantum action is to split the universe-before into a sheaf of
   universes-after, one for each possible way the state vector can
   collapse; in any one of the universes-after the result appears
   random.)  The steps are: 1. Permute the array randomly using a
   quantum process, 2. If the array is not sorted, destroy the
   universe (checking that it is sorted requires O(n) time). 
   Implementation of step 2 is left as an exercise for the reader.

<p><b>bogon</b> /boh'gon/ n. <p>
 [very common; by analogy with
   proton/electron/neutron, but doubtless reinforced after 1980 by the
   similarity to Douglas Adams's `Vogons'; see the <b><a href="#Bibliography">Bibliography</a></b>
   in Appendix C and note that Arthur Dent actually mispronounces
   `Vogons' as `Bogons' at one point] 1. The elementary particle of
   bogosity (see <b><a href="#quantum%20bogodynamics">quantum bogodynamics</a></b>).  For instance, "the
   Ethernet is emitting bogons again" means that it is broken or
   acting in an erratic or bogus fashion.  2. A query packet sent from
   a TCP/IP domain resolver to a root server, having the reply bit set
   instead of the query bit.  3. Any bogus or incorrectly formed
   packet sent on a network.  4. By synecdoche, used to refer to any
   bogus thing, as in "I'd like to go to lunch with you but I've got
   to go to the weekly staff bogon".  5. A person who is bogus or
   who says bogus things.  This was historically the original usage,
   but has been overtaken by its derivative senses 1-4.  See also

<p>The bogon has become the type case for a whole bestiary of nonce
   particle names, including the `clutron' or `cluon' (indivisible
   particle of cluefulness, obviously the antiparticle of the bogon)
   and the futon (elementary particle of <b><a href="#randomness">randomness</a></b>, or sometimes
   of lameness).  These are not so much live usages in themselves as
   examples of a live meta-usage: that is, it has become a standard
   joke or linguistic maneuver to "explain" otherwise mysterious
   circumstances by inventing nonce particle names.  And these imply
   nonce particle theories, with all their dignity or lack thereof (we
   might note parenthetically that this is a generalization from
   "(bogus particle) theories" to "bogus (particle theories)"!). 
   Perhaps such particles are the modern-day equivalents of trolls and
   wood-nymphs as standard starting-points around which to construct
   explanatory myths.  Of course, playing on an existing word (as in
   the `futon') yields additional flavor.  Compare <b><a href="#magic%20smoke">magic smoke</a></b>.

<p>It is claimed that `bogus' was originally used in the hackish
   sense at Princeton in the late 1960s.  It was spread to CMU and
   Yale by Michael Shamos, a migratory Princeton alumnus.  A glossary
   of bogus words was compiled at Yale when the word was first
   popularized there about 1975-76.  These coinages spread into
   hackerdom from CMU and MIT.  Most of them remained wordplay
   objects rather than actual vocabulary items or live metaphors. 
   Examples: `amboguous' (having multiple bogus interpretations);
   `bogotissimo' (in a gloriously bogus manner); `bogotophile'
   (one who is pathologically fascinated by the bogus);
   `paleobogology' (the study of primeval bogosity).

<p>Some bogowords, however, obtained sufficient live currency to be
   listed elsewhere in this lexicon; see <b><a href="#bogometer">bogometer</a></b>, <b><a href="#bogon">bogon</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#bogotify">bogotify</a></b>, and <b><a href="#quantum%20bogodynamics">quantum bogodynamics</a></b> and the related
   but unlisted <b><a href="#Dr.%20Fred%20Mbogo">Dr. Fred Mbogo</a></b>.

<p>By the early 1980s `bogus' was also current in something like
   hacker usage sense in West Coast teen slang, and it had gone
   mainstream by 1985.  A correspondent from Cambridge reports, by
   contrast, that these uses of `bogus' grate on British nerves; in
   Britain the word means, rather specifically, `counterfeit', as in
   "a bogus 10-pound note".  According to Merriam-Webster, the word
   dates back to 1825 and originally referred to a counterfeiting machine.

<p><b>boot</b> v.,n. <p>
 [techspeak; from `by one's bootstraps'] To
   load and initialize the operating system on a machine.  This usage
   is no longer jargon (having passed into techspeak) but has given
   rise to some derivatives that are still jargon.

<p>The derivative `reboot' implies that the machine hasn't been down
   for long, or that the boot is a <b><a href="#bounce">bounce</a></b> (sense 4) intended to
   clear some state of <b><a href="#wedgitude">wedgitude</a></b>.  This is sometimes used of
   human thought processes, as in the following exchange: "You've
   lost me."  "OK, reboot.  Here's the theory<small>...</small>."

<p>This term is also found in the variants `cold boot' (from
   power-off condition) and `warm boot' (with the CPU and all
   devices already powered up, as after a hardware reset or software
   crash).

<p>Another variant: `soft boot', reinitialization of only part of a
   system, under control of other software still running: "If
   you're running the <b><a href="#mess-dos">mess-dos</a></b> emulator, control-alt-insert will
   cause a soft-boot of the emulator, while leaving the rest of the
   system running."

<p>Opposed to this there is `hard boot', which connotes hostility
   towards or frustration with the machine being booted:  "I'll have
   to hard-boot this losing Sun."  "I recommend booting it
   hard."  One often hard-boots by performing a <b><a href="#power%20cycle">power cycle</a></b>.

<p>Historical note: this term derives from `bootstrap loader', a short
   program that was read in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in
   from the front panel switches.  This program was always very short
   (great efforts were expended on making it short in order to
   minimize the labor and chance of error involved in toggling it in),
   but was just smart enough to read in a slightly more complex
   program (usually from a card or paper tape reader), to which it
   handed control; this program in turn was smart enough to read the
   application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk
   drive.  Thus, in successive steps, the computer `pulled itself up
   by its bootstraps' to a useful operating state.  Nowadays the
   bootstrap is usually found in ROM or EPROM, and reads the first
   stage in from a fixed location on the disk, called the `boot
   block'.  When this program gains control, it is powerful enough to
   load the actual OS and hand control over to it.

<p><b>Borg</b> n. <p>
 In "Star Trek: The Next Generation" the

   all sentient life into itself; their slogan is "You will be
   assimilated. Resistance is futile."  In hacker parlance, the
   Borg is usually <b><a href="#Microsoft">Microsoft</a></b>, which is thought to be trying just
   as ruthlessly to assimilate all computers and the entire Internet
   to itself (there is a widely circulated image of Bill Gates as a
   Borg).  Being forced to use Windows or NT is often referred to as
   being "Borged".  Interestingly, the <b><a href="#Halloween%20Documents">Halloween Documents</a></b>
   reveal that this jargon is live within Microsoft itself.  (Other
   companies, notably Intel and UUNet, have also occasionally been
   equated to the Borg.) See also <b><a href="#Evil%20Empire">Evil Empire</a></b>, <b><a href="#Internet%20Exploiter">Internet Exploiter</a></b>.

<p>In IETF circles, where direct pressure from Microsoft is not a
   daily reality, the Borg is sometimes Cisco. This usage
   commemmorates their tendency to pay any price to hire talent away
   from their competitors.  In fact, at the Spring 1997 IETF, a large
   number of ex-Cisco employees, all former members of Routing Geeks,
   showed up with t-shirts printed with "Recovering Borg".

<p><b>bot</b> n <p>
 [common on IRC, MUD and among gamers; from
   `robot'] 1. An <b><a href="#IRC">IRC</a></b> or <b><a href="#MUD">MUD</a></b> user who is actually a program. 
   On IRC, typically the robot provides some useful service.  Examples
   are NickServ, which tries to prevent random users from adopting
   <b><a href="#nick">nick</a></b>s already claimed by others, and MsgServ, which allows one
   to send asynchronous messages to be delivered when the recipient
   signs on.  Also common are `annoybots', such as KissServ, which
   perform no useful function except to send cute messages to other
   people.  Service bots are less common on MUDs; but some others,
   such as the `Julia' bot active in 1990-91, have been remarkably
   impressive Turing-test experiments, able to pass as human for as
   long as ten or fifteen minutes of conversation. 2. An AI-controlled
   player in a computer game (especially a first-person shooter such
   as Quake) which, unlike ordinary monsters, operates like a
   human-controlled player, with access to a player's weapons and
   abilities.  An example can be found at
   <a href="http://www.telefragged.com/thefatal/">http://www.telefragged.com/thefatal/</a>.  3. Term used, though
   less commonly, for a web <b><a href="#spider">spider</a></b>.  The file for controlling
   spider behavior on your site is officially the "Robots Exclusion
   File" and its URL is "http://&lt;somehost&gt;/robots.txt")

<p>Note that bots in all senses were `robots' when the terms first
   appeared in the early 1990s, but the shortened form is now
   habitual.

 1. An Internet user that leeches off
   ISPs - the sort you can never provide good enough services for,
   always complains about the price, no matter how low it may be, and
   will bolt off to another service the moment there is even the
   slimmest price difference.  While most bottom feeders infest free or
   almost free services such as AOL, MSN, and Hotmail, too many flock
   to whomever happens to be the cheapest regional ISP at the
   time. Bottom feeders are often the classic problem user, known for
   unleashing spam, flamage, and other breaches of <b><a href="#netiquette">netiquette</a></b>.

<p><b>bottom-up implementation</b> n. <p>
 Hackish opposite of the
   techspeak term `top-down design'.  It has been received wisdom
   in most programming cultures that it is best to design from higher
   levels of abstraction down to lower, specifying sequences of action
   in increasing detail until you get to actual code.  Hackers often
   find (especially in exploratory designs that cannot be closely
   specified in advance) that it works best to <em>build</em> things in
   the opposite order, by writing and testing a clean set of primitive
   operations and then knitting them together.  Naively applied, this
   leads to hacked-together bottom-up implementations; a more
   sophisticated response is `middle-out implementation', in which
   scratch code within primitives at the mid-level of the system is
   gradually replaced with a more polished version of the lowest level
   at the same time the structure above the midlevel is being built.

   now-demolished <b><a href="#D.%20C.%20Power%20Lab">D. C. Power Lab</a></b> building used by the Stanford
   AI Lab in the 1970s had a volleyball court on the front lawn.  From

   loudly bouncing a volleyball on the floor outside the offices of
   known volleyballers.  3. To engage in sexual intercourse; prob. 
   from the expression `bouncing the mattress', but influenced by

<p><b>break-even point</b> n. <p>
 In the process of implementing a new
   computer language, the point at which the language is sufficiently
   effective that one can implement the language in itself.  That is,
   for a new language called, hypothetically, FOOGOL, one has reached
   break-even when one can write a demonstration compiler for FOOGOL
   in FOOGOL, discard the original implementation language, and
   thereafter use working versions of FOOGOL to develop newer ones. 
   This is an important milestone; see <b><a href="#MFTL">MFTL</a></b>.

<p>Since this entry was first written, several correspondents have
   reported that there actually was a compiler for a tiny Algol-like
   language called Foogol floating around on various <b><a href="#VAXen">VAXen</a></b> in the

<p><b>breath-of-life packet</b> n. <p>
 [XEROX PARC] An Ethernet packet
   that contains bootstrap (see <b><a href="#boot">boot</a></b>) code, periodically sent out
   from a working computer to infuse the `breath of life' into any
   computer on the network that has happened to crash.  Machines
   depending on such packets have sufficient hardware or firmware code
   to wait for (or request) such a packet during the reboot process. 
   See also <b><a href="#dickless%20workstation">dickless workstation</a></b>.

<p>The notional `kiss-of-death packet', with a function
   complementary to that of a breath-of-life packet, is recommended
   for dealing with hosts that consume too many network resources. 
   Though `kiss-of-death packet' is usually used in jest, there is
   at least one documented instance of an Internet subnet with limited
   address-table slots in a gateway machine in which such packets were
   routinely used to compete for slots, rather like Christmas shoppers
   competing for scarce parking spaces.

<p><b>Breidbart Index</b> /bri:d'bart ind*ks/ <p>
 A measurement of the
   severity of spam invented by long-time hacker Seth Breidbart, used
   for programming cancelbots. The Breidbart Index takes into account
   the fact that excessive multi-posting <b><a href="#EMP">EMP</a></b> is worse than
   excessive cross-posting <b><a href="#ECP">ECP</a></b>.  The Breidbart Index is computed
   as follows: For each article in a spam, take the square-root of the
   number of newsgroups to which the article is posted. The Breidbart
   Index is the sum of the square roots of all of the posts in the
   spam. For example, one article posted to nine newsgroups and again
   to sixteen would have BI = sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) = 7.  It is generally
   agreed that a spam is cancelable if the Breidbart Index exceeds
   20.

<p>The Breidbart Index accumulates over a 45-day window. Ten articles
   yesterday and ten articles today and ten articles tomorrow add up
   to a 30-article spam. Spam fighters will often reset the count if
   you can convince them that the spam was accidental
   and/or you have seen the error of your ways and won't repeat it. 
   Breidbart Index can accumulate over multiple authors. For example,
   the "Make Money Fast" pyramid scheme exceeded a BI
   of 20 a long time ago, and is now considered "cancel on sight".

 "Adding manpower to a late software

<p><b>brute force</b> adj. <p>
 Describes a primitive programming style,
   one in which the programmer relies on the computer's processing
   power instead of using his or her own intelligence to simplify the
   problem, often ignoring problems of scale and applying naive
   methods suited to small problems directly to large ones.  The term
   can also be used in reference to programming style: brute-force
   programs are written in a heavyhanded, tedious way, full of
   repetition and devoid of any elegance or useful abstraction (see
   also <b><a href="#brute%20force%20and%20ignorance">brute force and ignorance</a></b>).

<p>The <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b> example of a brute-force algorithm is associated
   with the `traveling salesman problem' (TSP), a classical
   <b><a href="#NP-">NP-</a></b>hard problem: Suppose a person is in, say, Boston, and
   wishes to drive to N other cities.  In what order should the
   cities be visited in order to minimize the distance travelled?  The
   brute-force method is to simply generate all possible routes and
   compare the distances; while guaranteed to work and simple to
   implement, this algorithm is clearly very stupid in that it
   considers even obviously absurd routes (like going from Boston to
   Houston via San Francisco and New York, in that order).  For very
   small N it works well, but it rapidly becomes absurdly
   inefficient when N increases (for N = 15, there are
   already 1,307,674,368,000 possible routes to consider, and for
   N = 1000 -- well, see <b><a href="#bignum">bignum</a></b>).  Sometimes,
   unfortunately, there is no better general solution than brute
   force.  See also <b><a href="#NP-">NP-</a></b>.

<p>A more simple-minded example of brute-force programming is finding
   the smallest number in a large list by first using an existing
   program to sort the list in ascending order, and then picking the
   first number off the front.

<p>Whether brute-force programming should actually be considered
   stupid or not depends on the context; if the problem is not
   terribly big, the extra CPU time spent on a brute-force solution
   may cost less than the programmer time it would take to develop a
   more `intelligent' algorithm.  Additionally, a more intelligent
   algorithm may imply more long-term complexity cost and bug-chasing
   than are justified by the speed improvement.

<p>Ken Thompson, co-inventor of Unix, is reported to have uttered the
   epigram "When in doubt, use brute force".  He probably intended
   this as a <b><a href="#ha%20ha%20only%20serious">ha ha only serious</a></b>, but the original Unix kernel's
   preference for simple, robust, and portable algorithms over
   <b><a href="#brittle">brittle</a></b> `smart' ones does seem to have been a significant
   factor in the success of that OS.  Like so many other tradeoffs in
   software design, the choice between brute force and complex,
   finely-tuned cleverness is often a difficult one that requires both
   engineering savvy and delicate esthetic judgment.

<p><b>bucky bits</b> /buh'kee bits/ n. <p>
 1. obs. The bits produced by
   the CONTROL and META shift keys on a SAIL keyboard (octal 200 and
   400 respectively), resulting in a 9-bit keyboard character set. 
   The MIT AI TV (Knight) keyboards extended this with TOP and
   separate left and right CONTROL and META keys, resulting in a
   12-bit character set; later, LISP Machines added such keys as
   SUPER, HYPER, and GREEK (see <b><a href="#space-cadet%20keyboard">space-cadet keyboard</a></b>).  2. By
   extension, bits associated with `extra' shift keys on any
   keyboard, e.g., the ALT on an IBM PC or command and option keys on
   a Macintosh.

<p>It has long been rumored that `bucky bits' were named for
   Buckminster Fuller during a period when he was consulting at
   Stanford.  Actually, bucky bits were invented by Niklaus Wirth when
   <em>he</em> was at Stanford in 1964-65; he first suggested the idea
   of an EDIT key to set the 8th bit of an otherwise 7-bit ASCII
   character).  It seems that, unknown to Wirth, certain Stanford
   hackers had privately nicknamed him `Bucky' after a prominent
   portion of his dental anatomy, and this nickname transferred to the
   bit.  Bucky-bit commands were used in a number of editors written
   at Stanford, including most notably TV-EDIT and NLS.

<p>The term spread to MIT and CMU early and is now in general use. 
   Ironically, Wirth himself remained unaware of its derivation for
   nearly 30 years, until GLS dug up this history in early 1993!  See

<p><b>buffer overflow</b> n. <p>
 What happens when you try to stuff
   more data into a buffer (holding area) than it can handle.  This
   problem is commonly exploited by <b><a href="#cracker">cracker</a></b>s to get arbitrary
   commands executed by a program running with root permissions.  This
   may be due to a mismatch in the processing rates of the producing
   and consuming processes (see <b><a href="#overrun">overrun</a></b> and <b><a href="#firehose%20syndrome">firehose syndrome</a></b>), or because the buffer is simply too small to hold all
   the data that must accumulate before a piece of it can be
   processed.  For example, in a text-processing tool that
   <b><a href="#crunch">crunch</a></b>es a line at a time, a short line buffer can result in
   <b><a href="#lossage">lossage</a></b> as input from a long line overflows the buffer and
   trashes data beyond it.  Good defensive programming would check for
   overflow on each character and stop accepting data when the buffer
   is full up.  The term is used of and by humans in a metaphorical
   sense.  "What time did I agree to meet you?  My buffer must have
   overflowed."  Or "If I answer that phone my buffer is going to
   overflow."  See also <b><a href="#spam">spam</a></b>, <b><a href="#overrun%20screw">overrun screw</a></b>.

<p><b>bug</b> n. <p>
 An unwanted and unintended property of a program or
   piece of hardware, esp. one that causes it to malfunction. 
   Antonym of <b><a href="#feature">feature</a></b>.  Examples: "There's a bug in the editor:
   it writes things out backwards."  "The system crashed because of
   a hardware bug."  "Fred is a winner, but he has a few bugs"
   (i.e., Fred is a good guy, but he has a few personality problems).

<p>Historical note: Admiral Grace Hopper (an early computing pioneer
   better known for inventing <b><a href="#COBOL">COBOL</a></b>) liked to tell a story in
   which a technician solved a <b><a href="#glitch">glitch</a></b> in the Harvard Mark II
   machine by pulling an actual insect out from between the contacts
   of one of its relays, and she subsequently promulgated <b><a href="#bug">bug</a></b> in
   its hackish sense as a joke about the incident (though, as she was
   careful to admit, she was not there when it happened).  For many
   years the logbook associated with the incident and the actual bug
   in question (a moth) sat in a display case at the Naval Surface
   Warfare Center (NSWC).  The entire story, with a picture of the
   logbook and the moth taped into it, is recorded in the "Annals
   of the History of Computing", Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981),
   pp. 285-286.

<p>The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads "1545
   Relay #70 Panel F (moth) in relay.  First actual case of bug being
   found".  This wording establishes that the term was already
   in use at the time in its current specific sense -- and Hopper
   herself reports that the term `bug' was regularly applied to
   problems in radar electronics during WWII.

<p>Indeed, the use of `bug' to mean an industrial defect was already
   established in Thomas Edison's time, and a more specific and rather
   modern use can be found in an electrical handbook from 1896
   ("Hawkin's New Catechism of Electricity", Theo. Audel &amp; Co.) 
   which says: "The term `bug' is used to a limited extent to
   designate any fault or trouble in the connections or working of
   electric apparatus."  It further notes that the term is "said to
   have originated in quadruplex telegraphy and have been transferred
   to all electric apparatus."

<p>The latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the
   term; that it came from telephone company usage, in which "bugs in
   a telephone cable" were blamed for noisy lines.  Though this
   derivation seems to be mistaken, it may well be a distorted memory
   of a joke first current among <em>telegraph</em> operators more than
   a century ago!

<p>Or perhaps not a joke.  Historians of the field inform us that the
   term "bug" was regularly used in the early days of telegraphy to
   refer to a variety of semi-automatic telegraphy keyers that would
   send a string of dots if you held them down.  In fact, the
   Vibroplex keyers (which were among the most common of this type)
   even had a graphic of a beetle on them (and still do)!  While the
   ability to send repeated dots automatically was very useful for
   professional morse code operators, these were also significantly
   trickier to use than the older manual keyers, and it could take
   some practice to ensure one didn't introduce extraneous dots into
   the code by holding the key down a fraction too long.  In the hands
   of an inexperienced operator, a Vibroplex "bug" on the line could
   mean that a lot of garbled Morse would soon be coming your way.

<p>Further, the term "bug" has long been used among radio technicians to
   describe a device that converts electromagnetic field variations into
   acoustic signals.  It is used to trace radio interference and look for
   dangerous radio emissions.  Radio community usage derives from the
   roach-like shape of the first versions used by 19th century physicists. 
   The first versions consisted of a coil of wire (roach body), with the two
   wire ends sticking out and bent back to nearly touch forming a spark gap
   (roach antennae).  The bug is to the radio technician what the stethoscope
   is to the stereotypical medical doctor.  This sense is almost certainly
   ancestral to modern use of "bug" for a covert monitoring device,
   but may also have contributed to the use of "bug" for the effects
   of radio interference itself.

<p>Actually, use of `bug' in the general sense of a disruptive event
   goes back to Shakespeare!  (Henry VI, part III - Act V, Scene II:
   King Edward: "So, lie thou there. Die thou; and die our fear; For
   Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.")  In the first edition of
   Samuel Johnson's dictionary one meaning of `bug' is "A frightful
   object; a walking spectre"; this is traced to `bugbear', a Welsh
   term for a variety of mythological monster which (to complete the
   circle) has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon
   through fantasy role-playing games.

<p>In any case, in jargon the word almost never refers to insects. 
   Here is a plausible conversation that never actually happened:

<p>"There is a bug in this ant farm!"

<p>"What do you mean?  I don't see any ants in it."

<p>"That's the bug."

<p>A careful discussion of the etymological issues can be found in a
   paper by Fred R. Shapiro, 1987, "Entomology of the Computer Bug:
   History and Folklore", American Speech 62(4):376-378.

<p>[There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved
   to the Smithsonian, and an earlier version of this entry so
   asserted.  A correspondent who thought to check discovered that the
   bug was not there.  While investigating this in late 1990, your
   editor discovered that the NSWC still had the bug, but had
   unsuccessfully tried to get the Smithsonian to accept it -- and
   that the present curator of their History of American Technology
   Museum didn't know this and agreed that it would make a worthwhile
   exhibit.  It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid-1991, but due to
   space and money constraints was not actually exhibited for years
   afterwards.  Thus, the process of investigating the
   original-computer-bug bug fixed it in an entirely unexpected way,
   by making the myth true!  --ESR]

<p><b>bum</b> <p>
 1. vt. To make highly efficient, either in time or
   space, often at the expense of clarity.  "I managed to bum three
   more instructions out of that code."  "I spent half the night
   bumming the interrupt code."  In 1996, this term and the practice it
   describes are semi-obsolete. In <b><a href="#elder%20days">elder days</a></b>, John McCarthy
   (inventor of <b><a href="#LISP">LISP</a></b>) used to compare some efficiency-obsessed
   hackers among his students to "ski bums"; thus, optimization
   became "program bumming", and eventually just "bumming".  2. To
   squeeze out excess; to remove something in order to improve
   whatever it was removed from (without changing function; this
   distinguishes the process from a <b><a href="#featurectomy">featurectomy</a></b>).  3. n. A small

   (and n. <b><a href="#tweak">tweak</a></b>, <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b>), though none of these exactly
   capture sense 2.  All these uses are rare in Commonwealth hackish,
   because in the parent dialects of English the noun `bum' is a rude synonym
   for `buttocks' and the verb `bum' for buggery.

<p><b>burn a CD</b> <p>
 To write a software or document distribution on
   writable CDROM. Coined from the fact that a laser is used to
   inscribe the information by burning small pits in the medium, and
   from the fact that disk comes out of the drive warm to the touch. 
   Writable CDs can be done on a normal desk-top machine with a
   suitable drive (so there is no protracted release cycle associated with
   making them) but each one takes a long time to make, so they are not
   appropriate for volume production.  Writable CDs are suitable for
   software backups and for short-turnaround-time low-volume software
   distribution, such as sending a beta release version to a few
   selected field test sites.  Compare <b><a href="#cut%20a%20tape">cut a tape</a></b>.

   steepest part of the <b><a href="#bathtub%20curve">bathtub curve</a></b> (see <b><a href="#infant%20mortality">infant mortality</a></b>).  2. A period of indeterminate length in which a person
   using a computer is so intensely involved in his project that he
   forgets basic needs such as food, drink, sleep, etc.  Warning:
   Excessive burn-in can lead to burn-out.  See <b><a href="#hack%20mode">hack mode</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#larval%20stage">larval stage</a></b>.

<p>Historical note:  the origin of "burn-in" (sense 1) is apparently
   the practice of setting a new-model airplane's brakes on fire, then
   extinguishing the fire, in order to make them hold better.  This was
   done on the first version of the U.S. spy-plane, the U-2.

<p><b>busy-wait</b> vi. <p>
 Used of human behavior, conveys that the
   subject is busy waiting for someone or something, intends to move
   instantly as soon as it shows up, and thus cannot do anything else
   at the moment.  "Can't talk now, I'm busy-waiting till Bill gets
   off the phone."

<p>Technically, `busy-wait' means to wait on an event by
   <b><a href="#spin">spin</a></b>ning through a tight or timed-delay loop that polls for
   the event on each pass, as opposed to setting up an interrupt
   handler and continuing execution on another part of the task.  In
   applications this is a wasteful technique, and best avoided on
   time-sharing systems where a busy-waiting program may <b><a href="#hog">hog</a></b> the
   processor.  However, it is often unavoidable in kernel programming. 
   In the Linux world, kernel busy-waits are usually referred to as
   `spinlocks'.

<p><b>buzz</b> vi. <p>
 1. Of a program, to run with no indication of
   progress and perhaps without guarantee of ever finishing; esp. 
   said of programs thought to be executing tight loops of code.  A
   program that is buzzing appears to be <b><a href="#catatonic">catatonic</a></b>, but never
   gets out of catatonia, while a buzzing loop may eventually end of
   its own accord.  "The program buzzes for about 10 seconds trying
   to sort all the names into order."  See <b><a href="#spin">spin</a></b>; see also
   <b><a href="#grovel">grovel</a></b>.  2. [ETA Systems] To test a wire or printed circuit
   trace for continuity, esp. by applying an AC rather than DC
   signal.  Some wire faults will pass DC tests but fail an AC buzz
   test.  3. To process an array or list in sequence, doing the same
   thing to each element.  "This loop buzzes through the tz array
   looking for a terminator type."

 [common] 1. Said of an operation (especially a
   repetitive, trivial, and/or tedious one) that ought to be performed
   automatically by the computer, but which a hacker instead has to
   step tediously through.  "My mailer doesn't have a command to
   include the text of the message I'm replying to, so I have to do it
   by hand."  This does not necessarily mean the speaker has to
   retype a copy of the message; it might refer to, say, dropping into
   a subshell from the mailer, making a copy of one's mailbox file,
   reading that into an editor, locating the top and bottom of the
   message in question, deleting the rest of the file, inserting `&gt;'
   characters on each line, writing the file, leaving the editor,
   returning to the mailer, reading the file in, and later remembering
   to delete the file.  Compare <b><a href="#eyeball%20search">eyeball search</a></b>.  2. By extension,
   writing code which does something in an explicit or low-level way
   for which a presupplied library routine ought to have been
   available.  "This cretinous B-tree library doesn't supply a decent
   iterator, so I'm having to walk the trees by hand."

<p><b>byte</b> /bi:t/ n. <p>
 [techspeak] A unit of memory or data equal to
   the amount used to represent one character; on modern architectures
   this is usually 8 bits, but may be 9 on 36-bit machines.  Some
   older architectures used `byte' for quantities of 6 or 7 bits, and
   the PDP-10 supported `bytes' that were actually bitfields of
   1 to 36 bits!  These usages are now obsolete, and even 9-bit bytes
   have become rare in the general trend toward power-of-2 word sizes.

<p>Historical note: The term was coined by Werner Buchholz in 1956
   during the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer;
   originally it was described as 1 to 6 bits (typical I/O equipment
   of the period used 6-bit chunks of information).  The move to an
   8-bit byte happened in late 1956, and this size was later adopted
   and promulgated as a standard by the System/360.  The word was
   coined by mutating the word `bite' so it would not be
   accidentally misspelled as <b><a href="#bit">bit</a></b>.  See also <b><a href="#nybble">nybble</a></b>.

<p><b>C</b> n. <p>
 1. The third letter of the English alphabet.  2. ASCII
   1000011.  3. The name of a programming language designed by Dennis
   Ritchie during the early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement
   <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b>; so called because many features derived from an earlier
   compiler named `B' in commemoration of <em>its</em> parent, BCPL. 
   (BCPL was in turn descended from an earlier Algol-derived language,
   CPL.)  Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled the question by designing
   <b><a href="#C++">C++</a></b>, there was a humorous debate over whether C's successor should
   be named `D' or `P'.  C became immensely popular outside Bell Labs
   after about 1980 and is now the dominant language in systems and
   microcomputer applications programming.  See also <b><a href="#languages%20of%20choice">languages of choice</a></b>, <b><a href="#indent%20style">indent style</a></b>.

<p>C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain
   varying according to the speaker, as "a language that combines
   all the elegance and power of assembly language with all the
   readability and maintainability of assembly language".

<p><b>C Programmer's Disease</b> n. <p>
 The tendency of the undisciplined
   C programmer to set arbitrary but supposedly generous static limits
   on table sizes (defined, if you're lucky, by constants in header
   files) rather than taking the trouble to do proper dynamic storage
   allocation.  If an application user later needs to put 68 elements
   into a table of size 50, the afflicted programmer reasons that he
   or she can easily reset the table size to 68 (or even as much as
   70, to allow for future expansion) and recompile.  This gives the
   programmer the comfortable feeling of having made the effort to
   satisfy the user's (unreasonable) demands, and often affords the
   user multiple opportunities to explore the marvelous consequences
   of <b><a href="#fandango%20on%20core">fandango on core</a></b>.  In severe cases of the disease, the
   programmer cannot comprehend why each fix of this kind seems only
   to further disgruntle the user.

<p><b>can't happen</b> <p>
 The traditional program comment for code
   executed under a condition that should never be true, for example a
   file size computed as negative.  Often, such a condition being true
   indicates data corruption or a faulty algorithm; it is almost
   always handled by emitting a fatal error message and terminating or
   crashing, since there is little else that can be done.  Some case
   variant of "can't happen" is also often the text emitted if the
   `impossible' error actually happens!  Although "can't happen"
   events are genuinely infrequent in production code, programmers
   wise enough to check for them habitually are often surprised at how
   frequently they are triggered during development and how many
   headaches checking for them turns out to head off. See also

 [Usenet] The archetype and model of
   all good <b><a href="#spam">spam</a></b>-fighters. Once upon a time, the 'Moose would send
   out spam-cancels and then post notice anonymously to
   <i>news.admin.policy</i>, <i>news.admin.misc</i>, and
   <i>alt.current-events.net-abuse</i>.  The 'Moose stepped to the fore on
   its own initiative, at a time (mid-1994) when spam-cancels were
   irregular and disorganized, and behaved altogether admirably -
   fair, even-handed, and quick to respond to comments and criticism,
   all without self-aggrandizement or martyrdom.  Cancelmoose[tm]
   quickly gained near-unanimous support from the readership of all
   three above-mentioned groups.

<p>Nobody knows who Cancelmoose[tm] really is, and there aren't even
   any good rumors.  However, the 'Moose now has an e-mail address
   (<a href="mailto:moose@cm.org">moose@cm.org</a>) and a web site (<a href="http://www.cm.org">http://www.cm.org</a>.)

<p>By early 1995, others had stepped into the spam-cancel business,
   and appeared to be comporting themselves well, after the 'Moose's

<p><b>candygrammar</b> n. <p>
 A programming-language grammar that is
   mostly <b><a href="#syntactic%20sugar">syntactic sugar</a></b>; the term is also a play on
   `candygram'.  <b><a href="#COBOL">COBOL</a></b>, Apple's Hypertalk language, and a lot
   of the so-called `4GL' database languages share this property. 
   The usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as
   possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled
   people to program.  This intention comes to grief on the reality
   that syntax isn't what makes programming hard; it's the mental
   effort and organization required to specify an algorithm precisely
   that costs.  Thus the invariable result is that `candygrammar'
   languages are just as difficult to program in as terser ones, and
   far more painful for the experienced hacker.

<p>[The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live
   should not be overlooked.  This was a "Jaws" parody.  Someone
   lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus ways to
   get the occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in the
   background.  The last attempt is a half-hearted "Candygram!" 
   When the door is opened, a shark bursts in and chomps the poor
   occupant.  [There is a similar gag in "Blazing Saddles" --ESR]
   There is a moral here for those attracted to candygrammars.  Note
   that, in many circles, pretty much the same ones who remember Monty
   Python sketches, all it takes is the word "Candygram!", suitably
   timed, to get people rolling on the floor. -- GLS]

<p><b>canonical</b> adj. <p>
 [very common; historically, `according
   to religious law'] The usual or standard state or manner of
   something.  This word has a somewhat more technical meaning in
   mathematics.  Two formulas such as 9 + x and x + 9
   are said to be equivalent because they mean the same thing, but the
   second one is in `canonical form' because it is written in the
   usual way, with the highest power of x first.  Usually there
   are fixed rules you can use to decide whether something is in
   canonical form.  The jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical
   meaning, acquired its present loading in computer-science culture
   largely through its prominence in Alonzo Church's work in
   computation theory and mathematical logic (see <b><a href="#Knights%20of%20the%20Lambda%20Calculus">Knights of the Lambda Calculus</a></b>).  Compare <b><a href="#vanilla">vanilla</a></b>.

<p>Non-technical academics do not use the adjective `canonical' in
   any of the senses defined above with any regularity; they do
   however use the nouns `canon' and `canonicity' (not
   **canonicalness or **canonicality). The `canon' of a given author
   is the complete body of authentic works by that author (this usage
   is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as well as to literary
   scholars).  `<em>The</em> canon' is the body of works in a given
   field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of music) deemed
   worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to investigate.

<p>The word `canon' has an interesting history.  It derives
   ultimately from the Greek
   `kanon'
   (akin to the English `cane') referring to a reed.  Reeds were used
   for measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word `canon'
   meant a rule or a standard.  The establishment of a canon of
   scriptures within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a
   rule for the religion.  The above non-techspeak academic usages
   stem from this instance of a defined and accepted body of work. 
   Alongside this usage was the promulgation of `canons' (`rules')
   for the government of the Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages
   ("according to religious law") derive from this use of the Latin
   `canon'.

<p>Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
   contrast with its historical meaning.  A true story: One Bob
   Sjoberg, new at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the
   incessant use of jargon.  Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS
   made a point of using as much of it as possible in his presence,
   and eventually it began to sink in.  Finally, in one conversation,
   he used the word `canonical' in jargon-like fashion without
   thinking.  Steele: "Aha!  We've finally got you talking jargon
   too!"  Stallman: "What did he say?"  Steele: "Bob just used
   `canonical' in the canonical way."

<p>Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly
   defined as the way <em>hackers</em> normally expect things to be. 
   Thus, a hacker may claim with a straight face that `according to
   religious law' is <em>not</em> the canonical meaning of
   `canonical'.

<p><b>cargo cult programming</b> n. <p>
 A style of (incompetent)
   programming dominated by ritual inclusion of code or program
   structures that serve no real purpose.  A cargo cult programmer
   will usually explain the extra code as a way of working around some
   bug encountered in the past, but usually neither the bug nor the
   reason the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully
   understood (compare <b><a href="#shotgun%20debugging">shotgun debugging</a></b>, <b><a href="#voodoo%20programming">voodoo programming</a></b>).

<p>The term `cargo cult' is a reference to aboriginal religions that
   grew up in the South Pacific after World War II.  The practices of
   these cults center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes and
   military style landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of
   the god-like airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the
   war.  Hackish usage probably derives from Richard Feynman's
   characterization of certain practices as "cargo cult science" in
   his book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" (W. W. Norton
   &amp; Co, New York 1985, ISBN 0-393-01921-7).

<p>A correspondent from England tells us that one of ICL's most

   service machines which the <b><a href="#field%20circus">field circus</a></b> had given up on. 
   Since he knew the design inside out, he could often find faults
   simply by listening to a quick outline of the symptoms.  He used to
   play on this by going to some site where the field circus had just
   spent the last two weeks solid trying to find a fault, and
   spreading a diagram of the system out on a table top.  He'd then
   shake some chicken bones and cast them over the diagram, peer at

<p>Among Unix fans, <code>cat(1)</code> is considered an excellent example
   of user-interface design, because it delivers the file contents
   without such verbosity as spacing or headers between the files, and
   because it does not require the files to consist of lines of text,
   but works with any sort of data.

<p>Among Unix haters, <code>cat(1)</code> is considered the <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b>
   example of <em>bad</em> user-interface design, because of its
   woefully unobvious name.  It is far more often used to <b><a href="#blast">blast</a></b> a

<p><b>CDA</b> /C-D-A/ <p>
 The "Communications Decency Act" of 1996,
   passed on <b><a href="#Black%20Thursday">Black Thursday</a></b> as section 502 of a major
   telecommunications reform bill. The CDA made it a federal crime in
   the USA to send a communication which is "obscene,
   lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse,
   threaten, or harass another person." It also threatened with
   imprisonment anyone who "knowingly" makes accessible to minors
   any message that "describes, in terms patently offensive as
   measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
   activities or organs".

<p>While the CDA was sold as a measure to protect minors from the
   putative evils of pornography, the repressive political aims of the
   bill were laid bare by the Hyde amendment, which intended to
   outlaw discussion of abortion on the Internet.

<p>To say that this direct attack on First Amendment free-speech
   rights was not well received on the Internet would be putting it
   mildly.  A firestorm of protest followed, including a February 29th
   mass demonstration by thousands of netters who turned their
   <b><a href="#home%20page">home page</a></b>s black for 48 hours.  Several civil-rights groups
   and computing/telecommunications companies mounted a constitutional
   challenge.  The CDA was demolished by a strongly-worded decision
   handed down in 8th-circuit Federal court and subsequently
   affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court on 26 June 1997 (`White
   Thursday'). See also <b><a href="#Exon">Exon</a></b>.

<p><b>cdr</b> /ku'dr/ or /kuh'dr/ vt. <p>
 [from LISP] To skip past
   the first item from a list of things (generalized from the LISP
   operation on binary tree structures, which returns a list
   consisting of all but the first element of its argument).  In the
   form `cdr down', to trace down a list of elements: "Shall we cdr
   down the agenda?"  Usage: silly.  See also <b><a href="#loop%20through">loop through</a></b>.

<p>Historical note: The instruction format of the IBM 704 that hosted
   the original LISP implementation featured two 15-bit fields called
   the `address' and `decrement' parts.  The term `cdr' was originally
   `Contents of Decrement part of Register'.  Similarly, `car' stood
   for `Contents of Address part of Register'.

<p>The cdr and car operations have since become bases for
   formation of compound metaphors in non-LISP contexts.  GLS recalls,
   for example, a programming project in which strings were
   represented as linked lists; the get-character and skip-character
   operations were of course called CHAR and CHDR.

<p><b>chad</b> /chad/ n. <p>
 1. [common] The perforated edge strips
   on printer paper, after they have been separated from the printed
   portion.  Also called <b><a href="#selvage">selvage</a></b>, <b><a href="#perf">perf</a></b>, and <b><a href="#ripoff">ripoff</a></b>. 
   2. The confetti-like paper bits punched out of cards or paper tape;
   this has also been called `chaff', `computer confetti', and
   `keypunch droppings'.  It's reported that this was very old Army
   slang (associated with teletypewriters before the computer era),
   and has been occasionally sighted in directions for punched-card
   vote tabulators long after it passed out of live use among computer
   programmers in the late 1970s.  This sense of `chad' returned to
   the mainstream during the finale of the hotly disputed
   U.S. presidential election in 2000 via stories about the Florida
   vote recounts.  Note however that in the revived mainstream usage
   chad is not a mass noun and `a chad' is a single piece of the stuff.

<p>There is an urban legend that `chad' (sense 2) derives from the
   Chadless keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little
   u-shaped tabs in the card to make a hole when the tab folded back,
   rather than punching out a circle/rectangle; it was clear that if
   the Chadless keypunch didn't make them, then the stuff that other
   keypunches made had to be `chad'.  However, serious attempts to
   track down "Chadless" as a personal name or U.S. trademark have
   failed, casting doubt on this etymology - and the U.S. Patent
   Classification System uses "chadless" (small c) as an adjective,
   suggesting that "chadless" derives from "chad" and not the
   other way around.  There is another legend that the word was
   originally acronymic, standing for "Card Hole Aggregate Debris",
   but this has all the earmarks of a <b><a href="#backronym">backronym</a></b>.  It has also
   been noted that the word "chad" is Scots dialect for gravel, but
   nobody has proposed any plausible reason that card chaff should be
   thought of as gravel.  None of these etymologies is really plausible.

   of the parent program is lost and there is no returning to it.

   of repeatedly running through the linked data areas searching for
   one which is of interest to the executing program.  The implication
   is that there is a very large number of links on the chain.

   notable channels are <code>#initgame</code>, <code>#hottub</code>,
   <code>callahans</code>, and <code>#report</code>.  At times of international
   crisis, <code>#report</code> has hundreds of members, some of whom take
   turns listening to various news services and typing in summaries of
   the news, or in some cases, giving first-hand accounts of the
   action (e.g., Scud missile attacks in Tel Aviv during the Gulf War
   in 1991).

<p><b>chawmp</b> n. <p>
 [University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a
   machine word).  This term was used by FORTH hackers during the late
   1970s/early 1980s; it is said to have been archaic then, and may
   now be obsolete.  It was coined in revolt against the promiscuous
   use of `word' for anything between 16 and 32 bits; `word' has
   an additional special meaning for FORTH hacks that made the
   overloading intolerable.  For similar reasons, /gaw'bl/ (spelled
   `gawble' or possibly `gawbul') was in use as a term for 32 or
   48 bits (presumably a full machine word, but our sources are
   unclear on this).  These terms are more easily understood if one
   thinks of them as faithful phonetic spellings of `chomp' and
   `gobble' pronounced in a Florida or other Southern U.S. dialect.

<p>A hand gesture commonly accompanies this.  To perform it, hold the
   four fingers together and place the thumb against their tips.  Now
   open and close your hand rapidly to suggest a biting action (much
   like what Pac-Man does in the classic video game, though this
   pantomime seems to predate that).  The gesture alone means `chomp
   chomp' (see "<b><a href="#Verb%20Doubling">Verb Doubling</a></b>" in the "<b><a href="#Jargon%20Construction">Jargon Construction</a></b>" section of the Prependices).  The hand may be
   pointed at the object of complaint, and for real emphasis you can
   use both hands at once.  Doing this to a person is equivalent to
   saying "You chomper!"  If you point the gesture at yourself, it
   is a humble but humorous admission of some failure.  You might do
   this if someone told you that a program you had written had failed
   in some surprising way and you felt dumb for not having anticipated
   it.

 A program component that traverses other

   ends.  Other utility programs that try to do too much with source
   code may turn into codewalkers.  As in "This new <code>vgrind</code>

<p><b>coefficient of X</b> n. <p>
 Hackish speech makes heavy use of
   pseudo-mathematical metaphors.  Four particularly important
   ones involve the terms `coefficient', `factor', `index of X', and
   `quotient'.  They are often loosely applied to things you cannot
   really be quantitative about, but there are subtle distinctions
   among them that convey information about the way the speaker
   mentally models whatever he or she is describing.

<p>`Foo factor' and `foo quotient' tend to describe something for
   which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical
   example is <b><a href="#fudge%20factor">fudge factor</a></b>.  It's not important how much you're
   fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed. 
   You might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor. 
   Quotient tends to imply that the property is a ratio of two
   opposing factors: "I would have won except for my luck quotient." 
   This could also be "I would have won except for the luck factor",
   but using <em>quotient</em> emphasizes that it was bad luck
   overpowering good luck (or someone else's good luck overpowering
   your own).

<p>`Foo index' and `coefficient of foo' both tend to imply
   that foo is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that
   can be larger or smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or
   person as having a `high bogosity index', whereas you would be less
   likely to speak of a `high bogosity factor'.  `Foo index' suggests
   that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane
   cost-of-living index; `coefficient of foo' suggests that foo is a
   fundamental quantity, as in a coefficient of friction.  The choice
   between these terms is often one of personal preference; e.g., some
   people might feel that bogosity is a fundamental attribute and thus
   say `coefficient of bogosity', whereas others might feel it is a
   combination of factors and thus say `bogosity index'.

<p><b>cokebottle</b> /kohk'bot-l/ n. <p>
 Any very unusual character,
   particularly one you can't type because it isn't on your
   keyboard.  MIT people used to complain about the
   `control-meta-cokebottle' commands at SAIL, and SAIL people
   complained right back about the `escape-escape-cokebottle'
   commands at MIT.  After the demise of the <b><a href="#space-cadet%20keyboard">space-cadet keyboard</a></b>, `cokebottle' faded away as serious usage, but was
   often invoked humorously to describe an (unspecified) weird or
   non-intuitive keystroke command.  It may be due for a second
   inning, however.  The OSF/Motif window manager, <code>mwm(1)</code>, has
   a reserved keystroke for switching to the default set of
   keybindings and behavior.  This keystroke is (believe it or not)
   `control-meta-bang' (see <b><a href="#bang">bang</a></b>).  Since the exclamation point
   looks a lot like an upside down Coke bottle, Motif hackers have
   begun referring to this keystroke as `cokebottle'.  See also

<p><b>COME FROM</b> n. <p>
 A semi-mythical language construct dual to the
   `go to'; <code>COME FROM</code> &lt;label&gt; would cause the referenced label
   to act as a sort of trapdoor, so that if the program ever reached
   it control would quietly and <b><a href="#automagically">automagically</a></b> be transferred to
   the statement following the <code>COME FROM</code>.  <code>COME FROM</code>
   was first proposed in R. Lawrence Clark's "A Linguistic
   Contribution to GOTO-less programming", which appeared in a 1973
   <b><a href="#Datamation">Datamation</a></b> issue (and was reprinted in the April 1984 issue of
   "Communications of the ACM").  This parodied the then-raging
   `structured programming' <b><a href="#holy%20wars">holy wars</a></b> (see <b><a href="#considered%20harmful">considered harmful</a></b>).  Mythically, some variants are the `assigned COME
   FROM' and the `computed COME FROM' (parodying some nasty control
   constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of course,
   multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having
   more than one <code>COME FROM</code> statement coming from the same
   label.

<p>In some ways the FORTRAN <code>DO</code> looks like a <code>COME FROM</code>
   statement.  After the terminating statement number/<code>CONTINUE</code>
   is reached, control continues at the statement following the DO. 
   Some generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than
   <code>CONTINUE</code>) for the statement, leading to examples like:

<pre>      DO 10 I=1,LIMIT
C imagine many lines of code here, leaving the
C original DO statement lost in the spaghetti...
      WRITE(6,10) I,FROB(I)
 10   FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4)
</pre>

<p>in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10. 
   (This is particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear
   to have anything to do with the flow of control at all!)

<p>While sufficiently astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this
   form of <code>COME FROM</code> statement isn't completely general.  After
   all, control will eventually pass to the following statement.  The
   implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN,
   ca. 1975 (though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040
   ten years earlier).  The statement <code>AT 100</code> would perform a
   <code>COME FROM 100</code>.  It was intended strictly as a debugging aid,
   with dire consequences promised to anyone so deranged as to use it
   in production code.  More horrible things had already been
   perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only
   contemplate the <code>ALTER</code> verb in <b><a href="#COBOL">COBOL</a></b>.

<p><code>COME FROM</code> was supported under its own name for the first
   time 15 years later, in C-INTERCAL (see <b><a href="#INTERCAL">INTERCAL</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#retrocomputing">retrocomputing</a></b>); knowledgeable observers are still reeling
   from the shock.

<p><b>Commonwealth Hackish</b> n. <p>
 Hacker jargon as spoken in
   English outside the U.S., esp. in the British Commonwealth.  It
   is reported that Commonwealth speakers are more likely to pronounce
   truncations like `char' and `soc', etc., as spelled (/char/,
   /sok/), as opposed to American /keir/ and /sohsh/.  Dots in
   <b><a href="#newsgroup">newsgroup</a></b> names (especially two-component names) tend to be
   pronounced more often (so soc.wibble is /sok dot wib'l/ rather
   than /sohsh wib'l/).

<p>Preferred <b><a href="#metasyntactic%20variable">metasyntactic variable</a></b>s include <b><a href="#blurgle">blurgle</a></b>,

   suffixes `-o-rama', `frenzy' (as in feeding frenzy), and
   `city' (examples: "barf city!"  "hack-o-rama!"  "core dump
   frenzy!").

<p>All the generic differences within the anglophone world inevitably show
   themselves in the associated hackish dialects.  The Greek letters beta
   and zeta are usually pronounced /bee't*/ and /zee't*/; meta may also be
   pronounced /mee't*/.  Various punctuators (and even letters - Z is
   called `zed', not `zee') are named differently: most crucially, for
   hackish, where Americans use `parens', `brackets' and `braces' for (),
   [] and {}, Commonwealth English uses `brackets', `square brackets' and
   `curly brackets', though `parentheses' may be used for the first; the
   exclamation mark, `!', is called pling rather than bang and the pound
   sign, `#', is called hash; furthermore, the term `the pound sign' is
   understood to mean the pound currency symbol
   (of course).

<p><b>compact</b> adj. <p>
 Of a design, describes the valuable property
   that it can all be apprehended at once in one's head.  This
   generally means the thing created from the design can be used with
   greater facility and fewer errors than an equivalent tool that is
   not compact.  Compactness does not imply triviality or lack of
   power; for example, C is compact and FORTRAN is not, but C is more
   powerful than FORTRAN.  Designs become non-compact through
   accreting <b><a href="#feature">feature</a></b>s and <b><a href="#cruft">cruft</a></b> that don't merge cleanly
   into the overall design scheme (thus, some fans of <b><a href="#Classic%20C">Classic C</a></b>

<p><b>computron</b> /kom'pyoo-tron`/ <p>
 n. 1. [common] A notional
   unit of computing power combining instruction speed and storage
   capacity, dimensioned roughly in instructions-per-second times
   megabytes-of-main-store times megabytes-of-mass-storage.  "That
   machine can't run GNU Emacs, it doesn't have enough computrons!" 
   This usage is usually found in metaphors that treat computing power
   as a fungible commodity good, like a crop yield or diesel
   horsepower.  See <b><a href="#bitty%20box">bitty box</a></b>, <b><a href="#Get%20a%20real%20computer!">Get a real computer!</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#toy">toy</a></b>, <b><a href="#crank">crank</a></b>.  2. A mythical subatomic particle that bears
   the unit quantity of computation or information, in much the same
   way that an electron bears one unit of electric charge (see also
   <b><a href="#bogon">bogon</a></b>).  An elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons
   has been developed based on the physical fact that the molecules in
   a solid object move more rapidly as it is heated.  It is argued
   that an object melts because the molecules have lost their
   information about where they are supposed to be (that is, they have
   emitted computrons).  This explains why computers get so hot and
   require air conditioning; they use up computrons.  Conversely, it
   should be possible to cool down an object by placing it in the path
   of a computron beam.  It is believed that this may also explain why
   machines that work at the factory fail in the computer room: the
   computrons there have been all used up by the other hardware.  (The
   popularity of this theory probably owes something to the
   "Warlock" stories by Larry Niven, the best known being
   "What Good is a Glass Dagger?", in which magic is fueled by
   an exhaustible natural resource called `mana'.)

   actually <em>patented</em> by <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b>, which reputedly refused to
   license the design and thus effectively locked third parties out of
   competition for the lucrative Massbus peripherals market.  This
   policy is a source of never-ending frustration for the diehards who
   maintain older PDP-10 or VAX systems.  Their CPUs work fine, but
   they are stuck with dying, obsolescent disk and tape drives with
   low capacity and high power requirements.

<p>(A closely related phenomenon, with a slightly different intent, is
   the habit manufacturers have of inventing new screw heads so that
   only Designated Persons, possessing the magic screwdrivers, can
   remove covers and make repairs or install options.  A good 1990s
   example is the use of Torx screws for cable-TV set-top boxes. 
   Older Apple Macintoshes took this one step further, requiring not
   only a long Torx screwdriver but a specialized case-cracking tool
   to open the box.)

<p>In these latter days of open-systems computing this term has fallen
   somewhat into disuse, to be replaced by the observation that
   "Standards are great!  There are so many of them to choose

<p><b>cons</b> /konz/ or /kons/ <p>
 [from LISP] 1. vt. To add a new
   element to a specified list, esp. at the top.  "OK, cons picking
   a replacement for the console TTY onto the agenda."  2. `cons
   up': vt. To synthesize from smaller pieces: "to cons up an
   example".

<p>In LISP itself, <code>cons</code> is the most fundamental operation for
   building structures.  It takes any two objects and returns a
   `dot-pair' or two-branched tree with one object hanging from each
   branch.  Because the result of a cons is an object, it can be used
   to build binary trees of any shape and complexity.  Hackers think
   of it as a sort of universal constructor, and that is where the
   jargon meanings spring from.

<p><b>considered harmful</b> adj. <p>
 [very common] Edsger
   W. Dijkstra's note in the March 1968 "Communications of the
   ACM", "Goto Statement Considered Harmful", fired the first
   salvo in the structured programming wars (text at
   <a href="http://www.acm.org/classics">http://www.acm.org/classics</a>).  Amusingly, the ACM considered
   the resulting acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by
   policy) no longer print an article taking so assertive a position
   against a coding practice. (Years afterwards, a contrary view was
   uttered in a CACM letter called, inevitably, "`Goto considered
   harmful' considered harmful'"'.  In the ensuing decades, a large
   number of both serious papers and parodies have borne titles of the
   form "X considered Y".  The structured-programming wars
   eventually blew over with the realization that both sides were
   wrong, but use of such titles has remained as a persistent minor
   in-joke (the `considered silly' found at various places in this
   lexicon is related).

 1. The operator's station of a <b><a href="#mainframe">mainframe</a></b>. 
   In times past, this was a privileged location that conveyed godlike
   powers to anyone with fingers on its keys.  Under Unix and other
   modern timesharing OSes, such privileges are guarded by passwords
   instead, and the console is just the <b><a href="#tty">tty</a></b> the system was booted
   from.  Some of the mystique remains, however, and it is traditional
   for sysadmins to post urgent messages to all users from the console
   (on Unix, /dev/console).  2. On microcomputer Unix boxes, the main
   screen and keyboard (as opposed to character-only terminals talking
   to a serial port).  Typically only the console can do real graphics
   or run <b><a href="#X">X</a></b>.

<p><b>Conway's Law</b> prov. <p>
 The rule that the organization of
   the software and the organization of the software team will be
   congruent; commonly stated as "If you have four groups working on
   a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler".  The original statement
   was more general, "Organizations which design systems are
   constrained to produce designs which are copies of the
   communication structures of these organizations."  This first
   appeared in the April 1968 issue of <b><a href="#Datamation">Datamation</a></b>. Compare
   <b><a href="#SNAFU%20principle">SNAFU principle</a></b>.

<p>The law was named after Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who
   wrote an assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE.  (The name
   `SAVE' didn't stand for anything; it was just that you lost fewer
   card decks and listings because they all had SAVE written on them.)

<p>There is also Tom Cheatham's amendment of Conway's Law:
   "If a group of N persons implements a COBOL compiler, there will be
   N-1 passes.  Someone in the group has to be the manager."

 A game between `assembler' programs in
   a machine or machine simulator, where the objective is to kill your
   opponent's program by overwriting it.  Popularized in the 1980s by
   A. K. Dewdney's column in "Scientific American" magazine, but
   described in "Software Practice And Experience" a decade
   earlier.  The game was actually devised and played by Victor
   Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and Doug McIlroy in the early 1960s
   (Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but
   was not involved).  Their original game was called `Darwin' and ran
   on a IBM 7090 at Bell Labs.  See <b><a href="#core">core</a></b>.  For information on the
   modern game, do a web search for the `rec.games.corewar
   FAQ' or surf to the <a href="http://www.koth.org">King Of The Hill</a> site.

   doesn't seem worth the bother of investigating.  "Hey, Eric -- I

   <b><a href="#phase%20of%20the%20moon">phase of the moon</a></b>.  The British seem to prefer the usage
   `cosmic showers'; `alpha particles' is also heard, because
   stray alpha particles passing through a memory chip can cause
   single-bit errors (this becomes increasingly more likely as memory
   sizes and densities increase).

<p>Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not
   (except occasionally in spaceborne computers).  Intel could not
   explain random bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis
   was cosmic rays.  So they created the World's Largest Lead Safe,
   using 25 tons of the stuff, and used two identical boards for
   testing.  One was placed in the safe, one outside.  The hypothesis
   was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit drops, they should see
   a statistically significant difference between the error rates on
   the two boards.  They did not observe such a difference.  Further
   investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due
   to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser
   degree uranium) in the encapsulation material.  Since it is
   impossible to eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly
   distributed through the earth's crust, with the statistically
   insignificant exception of uranium lodes) it became obvious that
   one has to design memories to withstand these hits.

<p><b>CPU Wars</b> /C-P-U worz/ n. <p>
 A 1979 large-format comic by
   Chas Andres chronicling the attempts of the brainwashed androids of
   IPM (Impossible to Program Machines) to conquer and destroy the
   peaceful denizens of HEC (Human Engineered Computers).  This rather
   transparent allegory featured many references to <b><a href="#ADVENT">ADVENT</a></b> and
   the immortal line "Eat flaming death, minicomputer mongrels!" 
   (uttered, of course, by an IPM stormtrooper).  The whole shebang
   is now <a href="http://www.e-pix.com/CPUWARS/cpuwars.html">available on the Web</a>.

<p>It is alleged that the author subsequently received a letter of
   appreciation on IBM company stationery from the head of IBM's
   Thomas J. Watson Research Laboratories (then, as now, one of the
   few islands of true hackerdom in the IBM archipelago).  The lower

<p><b>cracker</b> n. <p>
 One who breaks security on a system.  Coined
   ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of
   <b><a href="#hacker">hacker</a></b> (q.v., sense 8).  An earlier attempt to establish
   `worm' in this sense around 1981-82 on Usenet was largely a
   failure.

<p>Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against
   the theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. The
   neologism "cracker" in this sense may have been influenced not so
   much by the term "safe-cracker" as by the non-jargon term
   "cracker", which in Middle English meant an obnoxious person (e.g.,
   "What cracker is this same that deafs our ears / With this
   abundance of superfluous breath?" - Shakespeare's King John, Act
   II, Scene I) and in modern colloquial American English survives as
   a barely gentler synonym for "white trash".

<p>While it is expected that any real hacker will have done some
   playful cracking and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone
   past <b><a href="#larval%20stage">larval stage</a></b> is expected to have outgrown the desire to
   do so except for immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example,
   if it's necessary to get around some security in order to get some
   work done).

<p>Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom
   than the <b><a href="#mundane">mundane</a></b> reader misled by sensationalistic journalism
   might expect.  Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit, very
   secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
   poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to
   describe <em>themselves</em> as hackers, most true hackers consider
   them a separate and lower form of life.

<p>Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't
   imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than
   breaking into someone else's has to be pretty <b><a href="#losing">losing</a></b>.  Some
   other reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the

 [very common] The act of breaking into a

   common weaknesses in the security of target systems.  Accordingly,
   most crackers are only mediocre hackers.

   said of the <b><a href="#system">system</a></b> (q.v., sense 1), esp. of magnetic disk
   drives (the term originally described what happens when the air

   files in last night's disk crash."  A disk crash that involves the
   read/write heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and

<p>This usage is almost certainly derived from the fiction of

   "crawling horror" in his writings, but one of the fearsome Elder
   Gods that he wrote extensively about was Nyarlethotep, who had as
   an epithet "The Crawling Chaos". Certainly the extreme, even

<p><b>creeping featurism</b> /kree'ping fee'chr-izm/ n. <p>

<p>[common] 1. Describes a systematic tendency to load more
   <b><a href="#chrome">chrome</a></b> and <b><a href="#feature">feature</a></b>s onto systems at the expense of
   whatever elegance they may have possessed when originally designed. 
   See also <b><a href="#feeping%20creaturism">feeping creaturism</a></b>.  "You know, the main problem
   with <b><a href="#BSD">BSD</a></b> Unix has always been creeping featurism."  2. More
   generally, the tendency for anything complicated to become even
   more complicated because people keep saying "Gee, it would be even
   better if it had this feature too".  (See <b><a href="#feature">feature</a></b>.)  The
   result is usually a patchwork because it grew one ad-hoc step at a
   time, rather than being planned.  Planning is a lot of work, but
   it's easy to add just one extra little feature to help someone
   <small>...</small> and then another <small>...</small> and another<small>...</small>. When
   creeping featurism gets out of hand, it's like a cancer.  The GNU
   hello program, intended to illustrate <b><a href="#GNU">GNU</a></b> command-line switch
   and coding conventions, is also a wonderful parody of creeping
   featurism; the distribution changelog is particulary funny. 
   Usually this term is used to describe computer programs, but it
   could also be said of the federal government, the IRS 1040 form,
   and new cars.  A similar phenomenon sometimes afflicts conscious
   redesigns; see <b><a href="#second-system%20effect">second-system effect</a></b>.  See also <b><a href="#creeping%20elegance">creeping elegance</a></b>.

<p>Variant of <b><a href="#creeping%20featurism">creeping featurism</a></b>, with its own spoonerization:
   `feeping creaturitis'.  Some people like to reserve this form for

   opposed to the lurking general tendency in designers' minds. 
   (After all, -ism means `condition' or `pursuit of', whereas

<p><b>crippleware</b> n. <p>
 1. [common] Software that has some important
   functionality deliberately removed, so as to entice potential users
   to pay for a working version.  2. [Cambridge] Variety of

   which can be upgraded to a more expensive model by a trivial change
   (e.g., cutting a jumper).

<p>An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is Intel's 486SX
   chip, which is a standard 486DX chip with the co-processor diked
   out (in some early versions it was present but disabled).  To
   upgrade, you buy a complete 486DX chip with <em>working</em>
   co-processor (its identity thinly veiled by a different pinout) and
   plug it into the board's expansion socket.  It then disables the
   SX, which becomes a fancy power sink.  Don't you love Intel?

<p><b>crock</b> n. <p>
 [from the American scatologism `crock of
   shit'] 1. An awkward feature or programming technique that ought to
   be made cleaner.  For example, using small integers to represent
   error codes without the program interpreting them to the user (as
   in, for example, Unix <code>make(1)</code>, which returns code 139 for a
   process that dies due to <b><a href="#segfault">segfault</a></b>).  2. A technique that works
   acceptably, but which is quite prone to failure if disturbed in the
   least.  For example, a too-clever programmer might write an
   assembler which mapped instruction mnemonics to numeric opcodes
   algorithmically, a trick which depends far too intimately on the
   particular bit patterns of the opcodes.  (For another example of
   programming with a dependence on actual opcode values, see
   <b><a href="#The%20Story%20of%20Mel">The Story of Mel</a></b> in Appendix A.)  Many crocks have a tightly
   woven, almost completely unmodifiable structure.  See <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#brittle">brittle</a></b>.  The adjectives `crockish' and `crocky', and the
   nouns `crockishness' and `crockitude', are also used.

<p><b>crufty</b> /kruhf'tee/ adj. <p>
 [very common; origin unknown;
   poss. from `crusty' or `cruddy'] 1. Poorly built, possibly
   over-complex.  The <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b> example is "This is standard old
   crufty <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> software".  In fact, one fanciful theory of the
   origin of `crufty' holds that was originally a mutation of
   `crusty' applied to DEC software so old that the `s' characters
   were tall and skinny, looking more like `f' characters. 
   2. Unpleasant, especially to the touch, often with encrusted junk. 
   Like spilled coffee smeared with peanut butter and catsup. 
   3. Generally unpleasant.  4. (sometimes spelled `cruftie') n. 
   A small crufty object (see <b><a href="#frob">frob</a></b>); often one that doesn't fit
   well into the scheme of things.  "A LISP property list is a good
   place to store crufties (or, collectively, <b><a href="#random">random</a></b> cruft)."

<p>This term is one of the oldest in the jargon and no one is sure of
   its etymology, but it is suggestive that there is a Cruft Hall at
   Harvard University which is part of the old physics building; it's
   said to have been the physics department's radar lab during WWII. 
   To this day (early 1993) the windows appear to be full of random
   techno-junk.  MIT or Lincoln Labs people may well have coined the
   term as a knock on the competition.

<p><b>crunch</b> 1. vi. <p>
 To process, usually in a time-consuming or
   complicated way.  Connotes an essentially trivial operation that is
   nonetheless painful to perform.  The pain may be due to the
   triviality's being embedded in a loop from 1 to 1,000,000,000. 
   "FORTRAN programs do mostly <b><a href="#number-crunching">number-crunching</a></b>."  2. vt. To
   reduce the size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces bit
   configurations completely unrelated to the original data, such as
   by a Huffman code.  (The file ends up looking something like a
   paper document would if somebody crunched the paper into a wad.) 
   Since such compression usually takes more computations than simpler
   methods such as run-length encoding, the term is doubly
   appropriate.  (This meaning is usually used in the construction
   `file crunch(ing)' to distinguish it from <b><a href="#number-crunching">number-crunching</a></b>.) 
   See <b><a href="#compress">compress</a></b>.  3. n. The character <code>#</code>.  Used at XEROX
   and CMU, among other places.  See <b><a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a></b>.  4. vt. To squeeze
   program source into a minimum-size representation that will still
   compile or execute.  The term came into being specifically for a
   famous program on the BBC micro that crunched BASIC source in order
   to make it run more quickly (it was a wholly interpretive BASIC, so
   the number of characters mattered).  <b><a href="#Obfuscated%20C%20Contest">Obfuscated C Contest</a></b>
   entries are often crunched; see the first example under that entry.

<p><b>cut a tape</b> vi. <p>
 To write a software or document distribution
   on magnetic tape for shipment.  Has nothing to do with physically
   cutting the medium!  Early versions of this lexicon claimed that
   one never analogously speaks of `cutting a disk', but this has
   since been reported as live usage.  Related slang usages are
   mainstream business's `cut a check', the recording industry's
   `cut a record', and the military's `cut an order'.

<p>All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete
   recording and duplication technologies.  The first stage in
   manufacturing an old-style vinyl record involved cutting grooves in
   a stamping die with a precision lathe.  More mundanely, the
   dominant technology for mass duplication of paper documents in
   pre-photocopying days involved "cutting a stencil", punching away
   portions of the wax overlay on a silk screen.  More directly,
   paper tape with holes punched in it was an important early storage
   medium.  See also <b><a href="#burn%20a%20CD">burn a CD</a></b>.

<p><b>cyberpunk</b> /si:'ber-puhnk/ n.,adj. <p>
 [orig. by SF writer
   Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A subgenre of SF
   launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel
   "Neuromancer" (though its roots go back through Vernor Vinge's
   "True Names" (see the <b><a href="#Bibliography">Bibliography</a></b> in Appendix C) to
   John Brunner's 1975 novel "The Shockwave Rider").  Gibson's
   near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker
   culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and
   hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both
   irritatingly na&iuml;ve and tremendously stimulating.  Gibson's work
   was widely imitated, in particular by the short-lived but
   innovative "Max Headroom" TV series.  See <b><a href="#cyberspace">cyberspace</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#ice">ice</a></b>, <b><a href="#jack%20in">jack in</a></b>, <b><a href="#go%20flatline">go flatline</a></b>.

<p>Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or
   fashion trend that calls itself `cyberpunk', associated especially
   with the rave/techno subculture.  Hackers have mixed feelings about
   this.  On the one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to
   be shallow trendoids in black leather who have substituted
   enthusiastic blathering about technology for actually learning and
   <em>doing</em> it.  Attitude is no substitute for competence.  On the
   other hand, at least cyberpunks are excited about the right things
   and properly respectful of hacking talent in those who have it. 
   The general consensus is to tolerate them politely in hopes that
   they'll attract people who grow into being true hackers.

<p><b>cyberspace</b> /si:'br-spays`/ n. <p>
 1. Notional
   `information-space' loaded with visual cues and navigable with
   brain-computer interfaces called `cyberspace decks'; a
   characteristic prop of <b><a href="#cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a></b> SF.  Serious efforts to
   construct <b><a href="#virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a></b> interfaces modeled explicitly on
   Gibsonian cyberspace are under way, using more conventional devices
   such as glove sensors and binocular TV headsets.  Few hackers are
   prepared to deny outright the possibility of a cyberspace someday
   evolving out of the network (see <b><a href="#the%20network">the network</a></b>).  2. The
   Internet or <b><a href="#Matrix">Matrix</a></b> (sense #2) as a whole, considered as a
   crude cyberspace (sense 1).  Although this usage became widely
   popular in the mainstream press during 1994 when the Internet
   exploded into public awareness, it is strongly deprecated among
   hackers because the Internet does not meet the high, SF-inspired
   standards they have for true cyberspace technology. Thus, this use
   of the term usually tags a <b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b> or outsider.  Oppose
   <b><a href="#meatspace">meatspace</a></b>.  3. Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the
   mind of a person in <b><a href="#hack%20mode">hack mode</a></b>.  Some hackers report
   experiencing strong eidetic imagery when in hack mode;
   interestingly, independent reports from multiple sources suggest
   that there are common features to the experience.  In particular,
   the dominant colors of this subjective `cyberspace' are often
   gray and silver, and the imagery often involves constellations of
   marching dots, elaborate shifting patterns of lines and angles, or
   moire patterns.

<p><b>cycle</b> <p>
 1. n. The basic unit of computation.  What every
   hacker wants more of (noted hacker Bill Gosper described himself as
   a "cycle junkie"). One can describe an instruction as taking so
   many `clock cycles'.  Often the computer can access its memory
   once on every clock cycle, and so one speaks also of `memory
   cycles'.  These are technical meanings of <b><a href="#cycle">cycle</a></b>.  The jargon
   meaning comes from the observation that there are only so many
   cycles per second, and when you are sharing a computer the cycles
   get divided up among the users.  The more cycles the computer
   spends working on your program rather than someone else's, the
   faster your program will run.  That's why every hacker wants more
   cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to
   respond.  2. By extension, a notional unit of <em>human</em> thought
   power, emphasizing that lots of things compete for the typical
   hacker's think time.  "I refused to get involved with the Rubik's
   Cube back when it was big.  Knew I'd burn too many cycles on it if
   I let myself."  3. vt. Syn. <b><a href="#bounce">bounce</a></b> (sense 4), <b><a href="#120%20reset">120 reset</a></b>;
   from the phrase `cycle power'. "Cycle the machine again, that
   serial port's still hung."

<p><b>cycle crunch</b> n.,obs. <p>
 A situation wherein the number of
   people trying to use a computer simultaneously has reached the
   point where no one can get enough cycles because they are spread
   too thin and the system has probably begun to <b><a href="#thrash">thrash</a></b>.  This
   scenario is an inevitable result of Parkinson's Law applied to
   timesharing.  Usually the only solution is to buy more computer. 
   Happily, this has rapidly become easier since the mid-1980s, so
   much so that the very term `cycle crunch' now has a faintly archaic
   flavor; most hackers now use workstations or personal computers as
   opposed to traditional timesharing systems, and are far more likely
   to complain of `bandwidth crunch' on their shared networks rather than
   cycle crunch.

 A scarcity of cycles.  It may be due to a

<p><b>daemon</b> /day'mn/ or /dee'mn/ n. <p>
 [from the mythological
   meaning, later rationalized as the acronym `Disk And Execution
   MONitor'] A program that is not invoked explicitly, but lies
   dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur.  The idea is that
   the perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is
   lurking (though often a program will commit an action only because
   it knows that it will implicitly invoke a daemon).  For example,
   under <b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b>, writing a file on the <b><a href="#LPT">LPT</a></b> spooler's directory
   would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file. 
   The advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files
   printed need neither compete for access to nor understand any
   idiosyncrasies of the <b><a href="#LPT">LPT</a></b>.  They simply enter their implicit
   requests and let the daemon decide what to do with them.  Daemons
   are usually spawned automatically by the system, and may either
   live forever or be regenerated at intervals.

<p>Daemon and <b><a href="#demon">demon</a></b> are often used interchangeably, but seem to
   have distinct connotations.  The term `daemon' was introduced to
   computing by <b><a href="#CTSS">CTSS</a></b> people (who pronounced it /dee'mon/) and
   used it to refer to what ITS called a <b><a href="#dragon">dragon</a></b>; the prototype
   was a program called DAEMON that automatically made tape backups of
   the file system.  Although the meaning and the pronunciation have
   drifted, we think this glossary reflects current (2000) usage.

<p><b>Datamation</b> /day`t*-may'sh*n/ n. <p>
 A magazine that many
   hackers assume all <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>s read.  Used to question an unbelieved
   quote, as in "Did you read that in `Datamation?'" (But see
   below; this slur may be dated by the time you read this.) It used
   to publish something hackishly funny every once in a while, like
   the original paper on <b><a href="#COME%20FROM">COME FROM</a></b> in 1973, and Ed Post's
   "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" ten years later, but for
   a long time after that it was much more exclusively
   <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>-oriented and boring.  Following a change of editorship in
   1994, Datamation is trying for more of the technical content and
   irreverent humor that marked its early days.

<p>Datamation now has a WWW page at <a href="http://www.datamation.com">http://www.datamation.com</a>
   worth visiting for its selection of computer humor, including
   "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" and the `Bastard Operator
   From Hell' stories by Simon Travaglia (see <b><a href="#BOFH">BOFH</a></b>).

<p><b>dd</b> /dee-dee/ vt. <p>
 [Unix: from IBM <b><a href="#JCL">JCL</a></b>] Equivalent to
   <b><a href="#cat">cat</a></b> or <b><a href="#BLT">BLT</a></b>.  Originally the name of a Unix copy command
   with special options suitable for block-oriented devices; it was
   often used in heavy-handed system maintenance, as in "Let's
   <code>dd</code> the root partition onto a tape, then use the boot PROM to
   load it back on to a new disk".  The Unix <code>dd(1)</code> was
   designed with a weird, distinctly non-Unixy keyword option syntax
   reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL (which had an elaborate DD
   `Dataset Definition' specification for I/O devices); though the
   command filled a need, the interface design was clearly a prank. 
   The jargon usage is now very rare outside Unix sites and now nearly
   obsolete even there, as <code>dd(1)</code> has been <b><a href="#deprecated">deprecated</a></b> for a
   long time (though it has no exact replacement).  The term has been

<p><b>DDT</b> /D-D-T/ n. <p>
 [from the insecticide
   para-dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethene] 1. Generic term for a
   program that assists in debugging other programs by showing
   individual machine instructions in a readable symbolic form and
   letting the user change them.  In this sense the term DDT is now
   archaic, having been widely displaced by `debugger' or names of
   individual programs like <code>adb</code>, <code>sdb</code>, <code>dbx</code>, or
   <code>gdb</code>.  2. [ITS] Under MIT's fabled <b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b> operating system,
   DDT (running under the alias HACTRN, a six-letterism for `Hack
   Translator') was also used as the <b><a href="#shell">shell</a></b> or top level command
   language used to execute other programs.  3. Any one of several
   specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> hardware and
   CP/M.  The PDP-10 Reference Handbook (1969) contained a footnote on
   the first page of the documentation for DDT that illuminates the
   origin of the term:

<blockquote>
Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1
computer in 1961.  At that time DDT stood for "DEC Debugging
Tape".  Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has
propagated throughout the computer industry.  DDT programs are now
available for all DEC computers.  Since media other than tape are
now frequently used, the more descriptive name "Dynamic Debugging
Technique" has been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation.  Confusion
between DDT-10 and another well known pesticide,
dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane
(C14-H9-Cl5)
should be minimal since each attacks a
different, and apparently mutually exclusive, class of bugs. 
</blockquote>

<p>(The `tape' referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic but paper.) 
   Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the
   handbook after the <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>s took over and <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> became much more
   `businesslike'.

<p>The history above is known to many old-time hackers.  But there's
   more: Peter Samson, compiler of the original <b><a href="#TMRC">TMRC</a></b> lexicon,
   reports that he named `DDT' after a similar tool on the TX-0
   computer, the direct ancestor of the PDP-1 built at MIT's Lincoln
   Lab in 1957.  The debugger on that ground-breaking machine (the
   first transistorized computer) rejoiced in the name FLIT
   (FLexowriter Interrogation Tape).

<p><b>de-rezz</b> /dee-rez'/ <p>
 [from `de-resolve' via the movie
   "Tron"] (also `derez') 1. vi. To disappear or dissolve; the
   image that goes with it is of an object breaking up into raster
   lines and static and then dissolving.  Occasionally used of a
   person who seems to have suddenly `fuzzed out' mentally rather than
   physically.  Usage: extremely silly, also rare.  This verb was
   actually invented as <em>fictional</em> hacker jargon, and adopted in
   a spirit of irony by real hackers years after the fact.  2. vt. The
   Macintosh resource decompiler.  On a Macintosh, many program
   structures (including the code itself) are managed in small
   segments of the program file known as `resources'; `Rez' and
   `DeRez' are a pair of utilities for compiling and decompiling
   resource files.  Thus, decompiling a resource is `derezzing'. 
   Usage: very common.

<p><b>deadlock</b> n. <p>
 1. [techspeak] A situation wherein two or more
   processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for one of
   the others to do something.  A common example is a program
   communicating to a server, which may find itself waiting for output
   from the server before sending anything more to it, while the
   server is similarly waiting for more input from the controlling
   program before outputting anything.  (It is reported that this
   particular flavor of deadlock is sometimes called a `starvation
   deadlock', though the term `starvation' is more properly used for
   situations where a program can never run simply because it never
   gets high enough priority.  Another common flavor is
   `constipation', in which each process is trying to send stuff to
   the other but all buffers are full because nobody is reading
   anything.)  See <b><a href="#deadly%20embrace">deadly embrace</a></b>.  2. Also used of deadlock-like
   interactions between humans, as when two people meet in a narrow
   corridor, and each tries to be polite by moving aside to let the
   other pass, but they end up swaying from side to side without
   making any progress because they always move the same way at the
   same time.

<p><b>death code</b> n. <p>
 A routine whose job is to set everything in
   the computer -- registers, memory, flags, everything -- to zero,
   including that portion of memory where it is running; its last act
   is to stomp on its own "store zero" instruction.  Death code
   isn't very useful, but writing it is an interesting hacking
   challenge on architectures where the instruction set makes it
   possible, such as the PDP-8 (it has also been done on the DG Nova).

<p>Perhaps the ultimate death code is on the TI 990 series, where all
   registers are actually in RAM, and the instruction "store
   immediate 0" has the opcode "0". The PC will immediately wrap
   around core as many times as it can until a user hits HALT.  Any
   empty memory location is death code.  Worse, the manufacturer
   recommended use of this instruction in startup code (which would be
   in ROM and therefore survive).

   usage is particularly common among partisans of <b><a href="#BSD">BSD</a></b> Unix, who
   tend to regard the AT&amp;T versions as inferior and AT&amp;T as a bad guy. 
   Copies still circulate of a poster printed by Mt. Xinu showing a

   a broken AT&amp;T logo wreathed in flames.  2. AT&amp;T's internal
   magazine, "Focus", uses `death star' to describe an
   incorrectly done AT&amp;T logo in which the inner circle in the top
   left is dark instead of light -- a frequent result of
   dark-on-light logo images.

<p><b>DEC</b> /dek/ n. <p>
 1. v. Verbal (and only rarely
   written) shorthand for <i>decrement</i>, i.e. `decrease by one'. 
   Especially used by assembly programmers, as many assembly languages
   have a <code>dec</code> mnemonic.  Antonym: <b><a href="#inc">inc</a></b>.  2. n. Commonly
   used abbreviation for Digital Equipment Corporation, later
   deprecated by DEC itself in favor of "Digital" and now entirely
   obsolete following the buyout by Compaq.  Before the <b><a href="#killer%20micro">killer micro</a></b> revolution of the late 1980s, hackerdom was closely
   symbiotic with DEC's pioneering timesharing machines.  The first of
   the group of cultures described by this lexicon nucleated around
   the PDP-1 (see <b><a href="#TMRC">TMRC</a></b>).  Subsequently, the PDP-6, <b><a href="#PDP-10">PDP-10</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#PDP-20">PDP-20</a></b>, PDP-11 and <b><a href="#VAX">VAX</a></b> were all foci of large and
   important hackerdoms, and DEC machines long dominated the ARPANET
   and Internet machine population.  DEC was the technological leader
   of the minicomputer era (roughly 1967 to 1987), but its failure to
   embrace microcomputers and Unix early cost it heavily in profits
   and prestige after <b><a href="#silicon">silicon</a></b> got cheap.  Nevertheless, the
   microprocessor design tradition owes a major debt to the PDP-11
   instruction set, and every one of the major general-purpose
   microcomputer OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, Windows NT) was
   either genetically descended from a DEC OS, or incubated on DEC
   hardware, or both.  Accordingly, DEC was for many years still
   regarded with a certain wry affection even among many hackers too
   young to have grown up on DEC machines.

<p>DEC reclaimed some of its old reputation among techies in the first
   half of the 1990s.  The success of the Alpha, an
   innovatively-designed and very high-performance <b><a href="#killer%20micro">killer micro</a></b>,
   helped a lot.  So did DEC's newfound receptiveness to Unix and open
   systems in general.  When Compaq acquired DEC at the end of 1998
   there was some concern that these gains would be lost along with
   the DEC nameplate, but the merged company has so far turned out to
   be culturally dominated by the ex-DEC side.

<p><b>defenestration</b> n. <p>
 [mythically from a traditional Czech
   assasination method, via SF fandom] 1. Proper karmic retribution
   for an incorrigible punster.  "Oh, ghod, that was <em>awful</em>!" 
   "Quick! Defenestrate him!"  2. The act of exiting a window system
   in order to get better response time from a full-screen program. 
   This comes from the dictionary meaning of `defenestrate', which
   is to throw something out a window.  3. The act of discarding
   something under the assumption that it will improve matters.  "I
   don't have any disk space left."  "Well, why don't you
   defenestrate that 100 megs worth of old core dumps?"  4. Under a

   completely removing Micro$oft Windows from a PC in favor of a
   better OS (typically Linux).

<p><b>deflicted</b> <p>
 [portmanteau of "defective" and "afflicted";
   common among PC repair technicians, and probably originated among
   hardware techs outside the hacker community proper] Term used of
   hardware that is broken due to poor design or shoddy manufacturing
   or (especially) both; less frequently used of software and rarely
   of people.  This term is normally employed in a tone of weary

<p><b>demon</b> n. <p>
 1. [MIT] A portion of a program that is not
   invoked explicitly, but that lies dormant waiting for some
   condition(s) to occur.  See <b><a href="#daemon">daemon</a></b>.  The distinction is that
   demons are usually processes within a program, while daemons are
   usually programs running on an operating system.  2. [outside MIT]
   Often used equivalently to <b><a href="#daemon">daemon</a></b> -- especially in the
   <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b> world, where the latter spelling and pronunciation is
   considered mildly archaic.

<p>Demons in sense 1 are particularly common in AI programs.  For
   example, a knowledge-manipulation program might implement inference
   rules as demons.  Whenever a new piece of knowledge was added,
   various demons would activate (which demons depends on the
   particular piece of data) and would create additional pieces of
   knowledge by applying their respective inference rules to the
   original piece.  These new pieces could in turn activate more
   demons as the inferences filtered down through chains of logic. 
   Meanwhile, the main program could continue with whatever its
   primary task was.

<p><b>demoscene</b> /dem'oh-seen/ <p>
 [also `demo scene'] A culture of
   multimedia hackers located primarily in Scandinavia and northern
   Europe. Demoscene folklore recounts that when old-time <b><a href="#warez%20d00dz">warez d00dz</a></b> cracked some piece of software they often added an
   advertisement in the beginning, usually containing colorful
   <b><a href="#display%20hack">display hack</a></b>s with greetings to other cracking groups.  The
   demoscene was born among people who decided building these display
   hacks is more interesting than hacking - or anyway safer.  Around
   1990 there began to be very serious police pressure on cracking
   groups, including raids with SWAT teams crashing into bedrooms to
   confiscate computers.  Whether in response to this or for esthetic
   reasons, crackers of that period began to build self-contained
   display hacks of considerable elaboration and beauty (within the
   culture such a hack is called a <b><a href="#demo">demo</a></b>).  As more of these
   <b><a href="#demogroup">demogroup</a></b>s emerged, they started to have <b><a href="#compo">compo</a></b>s at
   copying parties (see <b><a href="#copyparty">copyparty</a></b>), which later evolved to
   standalone events (see <b><a href="#demoparty">demoparty</a></b>).  The demoscene has retained
   some traits from the <b><a href="#warez%20d00dz">warez d00dz</a></b>, including their style of
   handles and group names and some of their jargon.

<p>Traditionally demos were written in assembly language, with lots of
   smart tricks, self-modifying code, undocumented op-codes and the
   like.  Some time around 1995, people started coding demos in C, and
   a couple of years after that, they also started using Java.

<p>Ten years on (in 1998-1999), the demoscene is changing as its
   original platforms (C64, Amiga, Spectrum, Atari ST, IBM PC under
   DOS) die out and activity shifts towards Windows, Linux, and the
   Internet.  While deeply underground in the past, demoscene is
   trying to get into the mainstream as accepted art form, and one
   symptom of this is the commercialization of bigger
   demoparties. Older demosceners frown at this, but the majority think
   it's a good direction.  Many demosceners end up working in the
   computer game industry.   Demoscene resource pages are available at
   <a href="http://www.oldskool.org/demos/explained/">http://www.oldskool.org/demos/explained/</a> and

<p><b>dike</b> vt. <p>
 To remove or disable a portion of something, as a
   wire from a computer or a subroutine from a program.  A standard
   slogan is "When in doubt, dike it out".  (The implication is that
   it is usually more effective to attack software problems by
   reducing complexity than by increasing it.)  The word `dikes' is
   widely used among mechanics and engineers to mean `diagonal
   cutters', esp. the heavy-duty metal-cutting version; it also
   refers to a kind of wire-cutters used by electronics techs.  To
   `dike something out' means to use such cutters to remove
   something.  Indeed, the TMRC Dictionary defined dike as "to attack
   with dikes".  Among hackers this term has been metaphorically
   extended to informational objects such as sections of code.

 Said to occur when yet another

   hackers that these signal another stage in the long, slow dying of
   the <b><a href="#mainframe">mainframe</a></b> industry.  In its glory days of the 1960s, it
   was `IBM and the Seven Dwarfs': Burroughs, Control Data, General
   Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and Univac.  RCA and GE sold out
   early, and it was `IBM and the Bunch' (Burroughs, Univac, NCR,
   Control Data, and Honeywell) for a while.  Honeywell was bought out
   by Bull; Burroughs merged with Univac to form Unisys (in 1984 --
   this was when the phrase `dinosaurs mating' was coined); and in
   1991 AT&amp;T absorbed NCR (but spat it back out a few years
   later). Control Data still exists but is no longer in the mainframe
   business.  More such earth-shaking unions of doomed giants seem
   inevitable.

 The veneration
   of <b><a href="#Eris">Eris</a></b>, a.k.a. Discordia; widely popular among hackers. 
   Discordianism was popularized by Robert Shea and Robert Anton
   Wilson's novel "Illuminatus!" as a sort of self-subverting
   Dada-Zen for Westerners -- it should on no account be taken
   seriously but is far more serious than most jokes.  Consider, for
   example, the Fifth Commandment of the Pentabarf, from
   "Principia Discordia": "A Discordian is Prohibited of
   Believing What he Reads."  Discordianism is usually connected with
   an elaborate conspiracy theory/joke involving millennia-long
   warfare between the anarcho-surrealist partisans of Eris and a
   malevolent, authoritarian secret society called the Illuminati.

<p><b>Dissociated Press</b> n. <p>
 [play on `Associated Press'; perhaps
   inspired by a reference in the 1950 Bugs Bunny cartoon
   "What's Up, Doc?"] An algorithm for transforming any text
   into potentially humorous garbage even more efficiently than by
   passing it through a <b><a href="#marketroid">marketroid</a></b>.  The algorithm starts by
   printing any N consecutive words (or letters) in the text. 
   Then at every step it searches for any random occurrence in the
   original text of the last N words (or letters) already
   printed and then prints the next word or letter.  <b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b> has a
   handy command for this.  Here is a short example of word-based
   Dissociated Press applied to an earlier version of this Jargon
   File:

<blockquote>

<p><b>dogfood</b> n. <p>
 [Microsoft, Netscape] Interim software used
   internally for testing.  "To eat one's own dogfood" (from which
   the slang noun derives) means to use the software one is
   developing, as part of one's everyday development environment (the
   phrase is used outside Microsoft and Netscape). The practice is
   normal in the Linux community and elsewhere, but the term
   `dogfood' is seldom used as open-source betas tend to be quite
   tasty and nourishing.  The idea is that developers who are using
   their own software will quickly learn what's missing or broken. 
   Dogfood is typically not even of <b><a href="#beta">beta</a></b> quality.

<p><b>dogpile</b> v. <p>
 [Usenet: prob. fr. mainstream "puppy pile"]
   When many people post unfriendly responses in short order to a
   single posting, they are sometimes said to "dogpile" or "dogpile
   on" the person to whom they're responding.  For example, when a
   religious missionary posts a simplistic appeal to <i>alt.atheism</i>,
   he can expect to be dogpiled.  It has been suggested that this
   derives from U.S. football slang for a tackle involving three or
   more people; among hackers, it seems at least as likely to derive
   from an `autobiographical' Bugs Bunny cartoon in which a gang
   of attacking canines actually yells "Dogpile on the rabbit!".

<p><b>domainist</b> /doh-mayn'ist/ adj. <p>
 1. [Usenet, by pointed
   analogy with "sexist", "racist", etc.] Someone who judges
   people by the domain of their email addresses; esp. someone who
   dismisses anyone who posts from a public internet provider. "What
   do you expect from an article posted from <i>aol.com</i>?"  2. Said of an

<p><b>dongle</b> /dong'gl/ n. <p>
 1. [now obs.] A security or
   <b><a href="#copy%20protection">copy protection</a></b> device for proprietary software consisting of
   a serialized EPROM and some drivers in a D-25 connector shell,
   which must be connected to an I/O port of the computer while the
   program is run.  Programs that use a dongle query the port at
   startup and at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate if it
   does not respond with the dongle's programmed validation code. 
   Thus, users can make as many copies of the program as they want but
   must pay for each dongle.  The idea was clever, but it was
   initially a failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this
   way. By 1993, dongles would typically pass data through the port
   and monitor for <b><a href="#magic">magic</a></b> codes (and combinations of status lines)
   with minimal if any interference with devices further down the line
   -- this innovation was necessary to allow daisy-chained dongles
   for multiple pieces of software.  These devices have become rare as
   the industry has moved away from copy-protection schemes in
   general.  2. By extension, any physical electronic key or
   transferable ID required for a program to function.  Common
   variations on this theme have used parallel or even joystick ports. 
   See <b><a href="#dongle-disk">dongle-disk</a></b>.  3. An adaptor cable mating a special
   edge-type connector on a PCMCIA or on-board Ethernet card to a
   standard RJ45 Ethernet jack.  This usage seems to have surfaced in
   1999 and is now dominant.  Laptop owners curse these things because
   they're notoriously easy to lose and the vendors commonly charge
   extortionate prices for replacements.

<p>[Note: in early 1992, advertising copy from Rainbow Technologies (a
   manufacturer of dongles) included a claim that the word derived
   from "Don Gall", allegedly the inventor of the device.  The
   company's receptionist will cheerfully tell you that the story is a
   myth invented for the ad copy.  Nevertheless, I expect it to haunt
   my life as a lexicographer for at least the next ten years. :-(

<p><b>double bucky</b> adj. <p>
 Using both the CTRL and META keys.  "The
   command to burn all LEDs is double bucky F."

<p>This term originated on the Stanford extended-ASCII keyboard, and
   was later taken up by users of the <b><a href="#space-cadet%20keyboard">space-cadet keyboard</a></b> at
   MIT.  A typical MIT comment was that the Stanford <b><a href="#bucky%20bits">bucky bits</a></b>
   (control and meta shifting keys) were nice, but there weren't
   enough of them; you could type only 512 different characters on a
   Stanford keyboard.  An obvious way to address this was simply to
   add more shifting keys, and this was eventually done; but a
   keyboard with that many shifting keys is hard on touch-typists, who
   don't like to move their hands away from the home position on the
   keyboard.  It was half-seriously suggested that the extra shifting
   keys be implemented as pedals; typing on such a keyboard would be
   very much like playing a full pipe organ.  This idea is mentioned
   in a parody of a very fine song by Jeffrey Moss called
   "Rubber Duckie", which was published in "The Sesame
   Street Songbook" (Simon and Schuster 1971, ISBN 0-671-21036-X). 
   These lyrics were written on May 27, 1978, in celebration of the
   Stanford keyboard:

<pre>			Double Bucky

	Double bucky, you're the one!
	You make my keyboard lots of fun.
	    Double bucky, an additional bit or two:
	(Vo-vo-de-o!)
	Control and meta, side by side,
	Augmented ASCII, nine bits wide!
	    Double bucky!  Half a thousand glyphs, plus a few!
		Oh,
		I sure wish that I
		Had a couple of
		    Bits more!
		Perhaps a
		Set of pedals to
		Make the number of
		    Bits four:
		Double double bucky!
	Double bucky, left and right
	OR'd together, outta sight!
	    Double bucky, I'd like a whole word of
	    Double bucky, I'm happy I heard of
	    Double bucky, I'd like a whole word of you!

<p><b>down</b> <p>
 1. adj. Not operating.  "The up escalator is down"
   is considered a humorous thing to say (unless of course you were
   expecting to use it), and "The elevator is down" always means
   "The elevator isn't working" and never refers to what floor the
   elevator is on.  With respect to computers, this term has passed
   into the mainstream; the extension to other kinds of machine is
   still confined to techies (e.g. boiler mechanics may speak of a
   boiler being down).  2. `go down' vi. To stop functioning;

   `complexity of compiler design' and a knight bearing the lance
   `LALR parser generator' among his other trappings.  This one is

<p><b>dread high-bit disease</b> n. <p>
 A condition endemic to some
   now-obsolete computers and peripherals (including ASR-33 teletypes
   and PRIME minicomputers) that results in all characters having
   their high (0x80) bit forced on.  This of course makes transporting
   files to other systems much more difficult, not to mention the
   problems these machines have talking with true 8-bit devices.

<p>This term was originally used specifically of PRIME (a.k.a.  PR1ME)
   minicomputers.  Folklore has it that PRIME adopted the reversed-8-bit
   convention in order to save 25 cents per serial line per machine;
   PRIME old-timers, on the other hand, claim they inherited the
   disease from Honeywell via customer NASA's compatibility
   requirements and struggled heroically to cure it.  Whoever was
   responsible, this probably qualifies as one of the most
   <b><a href="#cretinous">cretinous</a></b> design tradeoffs ever made.  See <b><a href="#meta%20bit">meta bit</a></b>.

<p><b>Dread Questionmark Disease</b> <p>
 n. The result of saving HTML
   from Microsoft Word or some other program that uses the nonstandard
   Microsoft variant of Latin-1; the symptom is that various of those
   nonstandard characters in positions 128-160 show up as
   questionmarks.  The usual culprit is the misnamed `smart quotes'
   feature in Microsoft Word.  For more details (and a program called
   `demoroniser' that cleans up the mess) see

<p><b>droid</b> n. <p>
 [from `android', SF terminology for a humanoid
   robot of essentially biological (as opposed to
   mechanical/electronic) construction] A person (esp. a
   low-level bureaucrat or service-business employee) exhibiting most
   of the following characteristics: (a) naive trust in the wisdom of
   the parent organization or `the system'; (b) a blind-faith
   propensity to believe obvious nonsense emitted by authority figures
   (or computers!); (c) a rule-governed mentality, one unwilling or
   unable to look beyond the `letter of the law' in exceptional
   situations; (d) a paralyzing fear of official reprimand or worse if
   Procedures are not followed No Matter What; and (e) no interest in
   doing anything above or beyond the call of a very
   narrowly-interpreted duty, or in particular in fixing that which is
   broken; an "It's not my job, man" attitude.

<p>Typical droid positions include supermarket checkout assistant and
   bank clerk; the syndrome is also endemic in low-level government
   employees.  The implication is that the rules and official
   procedures constitute software that the droid is executing;
   problems arise when the software has not been properly debugged. 
   The term `droid mentality' is also used to describe the mindset
   behind this behavior. Compare <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>, <b><a href="#marketroid">marketroid</a></b>; see
   <b><a href="#-oid">-oid</a></b>.

<p>In England there is equivalent mainstream slang; a `jobsworth' is
   an obstructive, rule-following bureaucrat, often of the uniformed
   or suited variety.  Named for the habit of denying a reasonable
   request by sucking his teeth and saying "Oh no, guv, sorry I can't
   help you: that's more than my job's worth".

<p><b>drunk mouse syndrome</b> n. <p>
 (also `mouse on drugs') A malady
   exhibited by the mouse pointing device of some computers.  The
   typical symptom is for the mouse cursor on the screen to move in
   random directions and not in sync with the motion of the actual
   mouse.  Can usually be corrected by unplugging the mouse and
   plugging it back again.  Another recommended fix for optical mice
   is to rotate your mouse pad 90 degrees.

<p>At Xerox PARC in the 1970s, most people kept a can of copier
   cleaner (isopropyl alcohol) at their desks.  When the steel ball on
   the mouse had picked up enough <b><a href="#cruft">cruft</a></b> to be unreliable, the
   mouse was doused in cleaner, which restored it for a while. 
   However, this operation left a fine residue that accelerated the
   accumulation of cruft, so the dousings became more and more
   frequent.  Finally, the mouse was declared `alcoholic' and sent
   to the clinic to be dried out in a CFC ultrasonic bath.

<p><b>Duff's device</b> n. <p>
 The most dramatic use yet seen of <b><a href="#fall%20through">fall through</a></b> in C, invented by Tom Duff when he was at Lucasfilm. 
   Trying to <b><a href="#bum">bum</a></b> all the instructions he could out of an inner
   loop that copied data serially onto an output port, he decided to
   unroll it.  He then realized that the unrolled version could be
   implemented by <em>interlacing</em> the structures of a switch and a
   loop:

<pre>   register n = (count + 7) / 8;      /* count &gt; 0 assumed */

   switch (count % 8)
   {
   case 0:        do {  *to = *from++;
   case 7:              *to = *from++;
   case 6:              *to = *from++;
   case 5:              *to = *from++;
   case 4:              *to = *from++;
   case 3:              *to = *from++;
   case 2:              *to = *from++;
   case 1:              *to = *from++;
                      } while (--n &gt; 0);
   }
</pre>


<br><p>
<p>Shocking though it appears to all who encounter it for the first
   time, the device is actually perfectly valid, legal C.  C's default
   <b><a href="#fall%20through">fall through</a></b> in case statements has long been its most
   controversial single feature; Duff observed that "This code forms
   some sort of argument in that debate, but I'm not sure whether it's
   for or against." Duff has discussed the device in detail at
   <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html">http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html</a>.  Note
   that the omission of postfix <code>++</code> from <code>*to</code> was
   intentional (though confusing).  Duff's device can be used to
   implement memory copy, but the original aim was to copy values
   serially into a magic IO register.

<p><b>dumpster diving</b> /dump'-ster di:'-ving/ n. <p>
 1. The practice
   of sifting refuse from an office or technical installation to
   extract confidential data, especially security-compromising
   information (`dumpster' is an Americanism for what is elsewhere
   called a `skip').  Back in AT&amp;T's monopoly days, before paper
   shredders became common office equipment, phone phreaks (see
   <b><a href="#phreaking">phreaking</a></b>) used to organize regular dumpster runs against
   phone company plants and offices.  Discarded and damaged copies of
   AT&amp;T internal manuals taught them much.  The technique is still
   rumored to be a favorite of crackers operating against careless
   targets.  2. The practice of raiding the dumpsters behind buildings
   where producers and/or consumers of high-tech equipment are
   located, with the expectation (usually justified) of finding
   discarded but still-valuable equipment to be nursed back to health
   in some hacker's den.  Experienced dumpster-divers not infrequently

<p><b>DWIM</b> /dwim/ <p>
 [acronym, `Do What I Mean'] 1. adj. Able
   to guess, sometimes even correctly, the result intended when bogus
   input was provided.  2. n. obs. The BBNLISP/INTERLISP function
   that attempted to accomplish this feat by correcting many of the
   more common errors.  See <b><a href="#hairy">hairy</a></b>.  3. Occasionally, an
   interjection hurled at a balky computer, esp. when one senses one
   might be tripping over legalisms (see <b><a href="#legalese">legalese</a></b>).  4. Of a
   person, someone whose directions are incomprehensible and vague,
   but who nevertheless has the expectation that you will solve the
   problem using the specific method he/she has in mind.

<p>Warren Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and
   spelling errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and
   would often make hash of anyone else's typos if they were
   stylistically different.  Some victims of DWIM thus claimed that
   the acronym stood for `Damn Warren's Infernal Machine!'.

<p>In one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the
   command interpreter used at Xerox PARC.  One day another hacker
   there typed <code>delete *$</code> to free up some disk space.  (The
   editor there named backup files by appending <code>$</code> to the
   original file name, so he was trying to delete any backup files
   left over from old editing sessions.)  It happened that there
   weren't any editor backup files, so DWIM helpfully reported
   <code>*$ not found, assuming you meant 'delete *'.</code> It then started
   to delete all the files on the disk!  The hacker managed to stop it
   with a <b><a href="#Vulcan%20nerve%20pinch">Vulcan nerve pinch</a></b> after only a half dozen or so files
   were lost.

<p>The disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go
   to Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his
   workstation, and then type <code>delete *$</code> twice.

<p>DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex
   program; it is also occasionally described as the single
   instruction the ideal computer would have.  Back when proofs of
   program correctness were in vogue, there were also jokes about
   `DWIMC' (Do What I Mean, Correctly).  A related term, more often

 [from the custom of the Easter Egg hunt
   observed in the U.S. and many parts of Europe] 1. A message hidden
   in the object code of a program as a joke, intended to be found by

   or sound effect emitted by a program (or, on a PC, the BIOS ROM) in
   response to some undocumented set of commands or keystrokes,
   intended as a joke or to display program credits.  One well-known
   early Easter egg found in a couple of OSes caused them to respond
   to the command <code>make love</code> with <code>not war?</code>.  Many
   personal computers have much more elaborate eggs hidden in ROM,
   including lists of the developers' names, political exhortations,
   snatches of music, and (in one case) graphics images of the entire
   development team.

 [IBM] The sort said to be possessed by
   persons for whom the transition from <b><a href="#punched%20card">punched card</a></b> to tape was
   traumatic (nobody has dared tell them about disks yet).  It is said
   that these people, including (according to an old joke) the founder
   of IBM, will be buried `face down, 9-edge first' (the 9-edge being
   the bottom of the card).  This directive is inscribed on IBM's 1402
   and 1622 card readers and is referenced in a famous bit of doggerel
   called "The Last Bug", the climactic lines of which are as
   follows:

<pre>   He died at the console
   Of hunger and thirst.
   Next day he was buried,
   Face down, 9-edge first.
</pre>

<p>The eighty-column mind was thought by most hackers to dominate

<p><b>El Camino Bignum</b> /el' k*-mee'noh big'nuhm/ n. <p>
 The road
   mundanely called El Camino Real, running along San Francisco
   peninsula.  It originally extended all the way down to Mexico City;
   many portions of the old road are still intact.  Navigation on the
   San Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real,
   which defines <b><a href="#logical">logical</a></b> north and south even though it isn't
   really north-south in many places.  El Camino Real runs right past
   Stanford University and so is familiar to hackers.

<p>The Spanish word `real' (which has two syllables: /ray-ahl'/)
   means `royal'; El Camino Real is `the royal road'.  In the FORTRAN
   language, a `real' quantity is a number typically precise to seven
   significant digits, and a `double precision' quantity is a larger
   floating-point number, precise to perhaps fourteen significant
   digits (other languages have similar `real' types).

<p>When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976, he remarked what a
   long road El Camino Real was.  Making a pun on `real', he started
   calling it `El Camino Double Precision' -- but when the hacker
   was told that the road was hundreds of miles long, he renamed it
   `El Camino Bignum', and that name has stuck.  (See <b><a href="#bignum">bignum</a></b>.)

<p>[GLS has since let slip that the unnamed hacker in this story was
   in fact himself --ESR]

<p>In recent years, the synonym `El Camino Virtual' has been
   reported as an alternate at IBM and Amdahl sites in the Valley. 
   Mathematically literate hackers in the Valley have also been heard
   to refer to some major cross-street intersecting El Camino Real as
   "El Camino Imaginary".  One popular theory is that the
   intersection is located near Moffett Field - where they keep all
   those complex planes.

<p><b>ELIZA effect</b> /*-li:'z* *-fekt'/ n. <p>
 [AI community] The
   tendency of humans to attach associations to terms from prior
   experience.  For example, there is nothing magic about the symbol
   <code>+</code> that makes it well-suited to indicate addition; it's just
   that people associate it with addition.  Using <code>+</code> or `plus'
   to mean addition in a computer language is taking advantage of the
   ELIZA effect.

<p>This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum,
   which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by rephrasing many of
   the patient's statements as questions and posing them to the
   patient.  It worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution
   of key words into canned phrases.  It was so convincing, however,
   that there are many anecdotes about people becoming very
   emotionally caught up in dealing with ELIZA.  All this was due to
   people's tendency to attach to words meanings which the computer
   never put there.  The ELIZA effect is a <b><a href="#Good%20Thing">Good Thing</a></b> when

<p><b>EMACS</b> /ee'maks/ n. <p>
 [from Editing MACroS] The ne plus
   ultra of hacker editors, a programmable text editor with an entire
   LISP system inside it.  It was originally written by Richard
   Stallman in <b><a href="#TECO">TECO</a></b> under <b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b> at the MIT AI lab; AI Memo 554
   described it as "an advanced, self-documenting, customizable,
   extensible real-time display editor".  It has since been
   reimplemented any number of times, by various hackers, and versions
   exist that run under most major operating systems.  Perhaps the
   most widely used version, also written by Stallman and now called
   "<b><a href="#GNU">GNU</a></b> EMACS" or <b><a href="#GNUMACS">GNUMACS</a></b>, runs principally under Unix. 
   (Its close relative XEmacs is the second most popular version.)  It
   includes facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and
   receive mail or news; many hackers spend up to 80% of their
   <b><a href="#tube%20time">tube time</a></b> inside it.  Other variants include <b><a href="#GOSMACS">GOSMACS</a></b>, CCA
   EMACS, UniPress EMACS, Montgomery EMACS, jove, epsilon, and
   MicroEMACS.  (Though we use the original all-caps spelling here, it
   is nowadays very commonly `Emacs'.)

<p>Some EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an

<p><b>email</b> /ee'mayl/ <p>
 (also written `e-mail' and `E-mail')
   1. n. Electronic mail automatically passed through computer
   networks and/or via modems over common-carrier lines.  Contrast
   <b><a href="#snail-mail">snail-mail</a></b>, <b><a href="#paper-net">paper-net</a></b>, <b><a href="#voice-net">voice-net</a></b>.  See <b><a href="#network%20address">network address</a></b>.  2. vt. To send electronic mail.

<p>Oddly enough, the word `emailed' is actually listed in the OED;
   it means "embossed (with a raised pattern) or perh. arranged in a
   net or open work".  A use from 1480 is given. The word is probably
   derived from French `&eacute;maill&eacute;' (enameled) and related to Old
   French `emmaille&uuml;re' (network).  A French correspondent tells
   us that in modern French, `email' is a hard enamel obtained by
   heating special paints in a furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e) is
   a craftsman who makes email (he generally paints some objects
   (like, say, jewelry) and cooks them in a furnace).

<p>There are numerous spelling variants of this word.  In Internet
   traffic up to 1995, `email' predominates, `e-mail' runs a
   not-too-distant second, and `E-mail' and `Email' are a distant
   third and fourth.

<p><b>emoticon</b> /ee-moh'ti-kon/ n. <p>
 [common] An ASCII glyph
   used to indicate an emotional state in email or news.  Although
   originally intended mostly as jokes, emoticons (or some other
   explicit humor indication) are virtually required under certain
   circumstances in high-volume text-only communication forums such as
   Usenet; the lack of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what
   were intended to be humorous, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise
   non-100%-serious comments to be badly misinterpreted (not always
   even by <b><a href="#newbie">newbie</a></b>s), resulting in arguments and <b><a href="#flame%20war">flame war</a></b>s.

<p>Hundreds of emoticons have been proposed, but only a few are in
   common use.  These include:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><tt>:-)</tt>
<dd>`smiley face' (for humor, laughter, friendliness,
occasionally sarcasm)

<dt><tt>:-(</tt>
<dd>`frowney face' (for sadness, anger, or upset)

<dt><tt>;-)</tt>
<dd>`half-smiley' (<b><a href="#ha%20ha%20only%20serious">ha ha only serious</a></b>);
also known as `semi-smiley' or `winkey face'.

<dt><tt>:-/</tt>
<dd>`wry face'
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>(These may become more comprehensible if you tilt your head
   sideways, to the left.)

<p>The first two listed are by far the most frequently encountered. 
   Hyphenless forms of them are common on CompuServe, GEnie, and BIX;
   see also <b><a href="#bixie">bixie</a></b>.  On <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b>, `smiley' is often used as a
   generic term synonymous with <b><a href="#emoticon">emoticon</a></b>, as well as specifically
   for the happy-face emoticon.

<p>It was long thought that the emoticon was invented by one Scott
   Fahlman on the CMU <b><a href="#bboard">bboard</a></b> systems sometime between early 1981
   and mid-1982.  He later wrote: "I wish I had saved the original
   post, or at least recorded the date for posterity, but I had no
   idea that I was starting something that would soon pollute all the
   world's communication channels."  [GLS confirms that he remembers
   this original posting].

<p>There is a rival claim by  one KevinMcKenzie, who seems to have
   proposed the smiley on the MsgGroup mailing list, April 12 1979. 
   It seems likely these two inventions were independent.

<p>Note for the <b><a href="#newbie">newbie</a></b>: Overuse of the smiley is a mark of
   loserhood!  More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure sign that
   you've gone over the line.

<p><b>empire</b> n. <p>
 Any of a family of military simulations derived
   from a game written by Peter Langston many years ago.  A number of
   multi-player variants of varying degrees of sophistication exist,
   and one single-player version implemented for both Unix and VMS;
   the latter is even available as MS-DOS freeware.  All are
   notoriously addictive.  Of various commercial derivatives the
   best known is probably "Empire Deluxe" on PCs and Amigas.

<p>Modern empire is a real-time wargame played over the internet
   by up to 120 players. Typical games last from 24 hours (blitz) to
   a couple of months (long term).  The amount of sleep you can get
   while playing is a function of the rate at which updates occur and
   the number of co-rulers of your country.  Empire server software is
   available for Unix-like machines, and clients for Unix and other
   platforms.  A comprehensive history of the game is available at
   <a href="http://www.empire.cx/infopages/History.html">http://www.empire.cx/infopages/History.html</a>.  The
   Empire resource site is at <a href="http://www.empire.cx/">http://www.empire.cx/</a>.

<p><b>engine</b> n. <p>
 1. A piece of hardware that encapsulates some
   function but can't be used without some kind of <b><a href="#front%20end">front end</a></b>. 
   Today we have, especially, `print engine': the guts of a laser
   printer.  2. An analogous piece of software; notionally, one that
   does a lot of noisy crunching, such as a `database engine'.

<p>The hacker senses of `engine' are actually close to its original,
   pre-Industrial-Revolution sense of a skill, clever device, or
   instrument (the word is cognate to `ingenuity').  This sense had
   not been completely eclipsed by the modern connotation of
   power-transducing machinery in Charles Babbage's time, which
   explains why he named the stored-program computer that
   he designed in 1844 the `Analytical Engine'.

 1. n. obs. The source code for a program, which may
   be in any language, as opposed to the linkable or executable binary

   sequential character-input functions (and their equivalents in

   think it's ^\.  2. [Unix] The keyboard character (usually control-D,
   the ASCII EOT (End Of Transmission) character) that is mapped by
   the terminal driver into an end-of-file condition.  3. Used by
   extension in non-computer contexts when a human is doing something
   that can be modeled as a sequential read and can't go further. 
   "Yeah, I looked for a list of 360 mnemonics to post as a joke, but

<p><b>epoch</b> n. <p>
 [Unix: prob. from astronomical timekeeping] The
   time and date corresponding to 0 in an operating system's clock and
   timestamp values.  Under most Unix versions the epoch is 00:00:00
   GMT, January 1, 1970; under VMS, it's 00:00:00 of November 17, 1858
   (base date of the U.S. Naval Observatory's ephemerides); on a
   Macintosh, it's the midnight beginning January 1 1904.  System time
   is measured in seconds or <b><a href="#tick">tick</a></b>s past the epoch.  Weird
   problems may ensue when the clock wraps around (see <b><a href="#wrap%20around">wrap around</a></b>), which is not necessarily a rare event; on systems
   counting 10 ticks per second, a signed 32-bit count of ticks is
   good only for 6.8 years.  The 1-tick-per-second clock of Unix is
   good only until January 18, 2038, assuming at least some software
   continues to consider it signed and that word lengths don't
   increase by then.  See also <b><a href="#wall%20time">wall time</a></b>.  Microsoft Windows, on
   the other hand, has an epoch problem every 49.7 days - but this
   is seldom noticed as Windows is almost incapable of staying

<p><b>Eric Conspiracy</b> n. <p>
 A shadowy group of mustachioed
   hackers named Eric first pinpointed as a sinister conspiracy by an
   infamous <i>talk.bizarre</i> posting ca. 1987; this was doubtless
   influenced by the numerous `Eric' jokes in the Monty Python
   oeuvre.  There do indeed seem to be considerably more mustachioed
   Erics in hackerdom than the frequency of these three traits can
   account for unless they are correlated in some arcane way. 
   Well-known examples include Eric Allman (he of the `Allman style'
   described under <b><a href="#indent%20style">indent style</a></b>) and Erik Fair (co-author of
   NNTP); your editor has heard from more than a hundred others by
   email, and the organization line `Eric Conspiracy Secret

<p><b>evil</b> adj. <p>
 As used by hackers, implies that some system,
   program, person, or institution is sufficiently maldesigned as to
   be not worth the bother of dealing with.  Unlike the adjectives in
   the <b><a href="#cretinous">cretinous</a></b>/<b><a href="#losing">losing</a></b>/<b><a href="#brain-damaged">brain-damaged</a></b> series, `evil'
   does not imply incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of
   goals or design criteria fatally incompatible with the speaker's. 
   This usage is more an esthetic and engineering judgment than a
   moral one in the mainstream sense.  "We thought about adding a
   <b><a href="#Blue%20Glue">Blue Glue</a></b> interface but decided it was too evil to deal
   with."  "<b><a href="#TECO">TECO</a></b> is neat, but it can be pretty evil if you're
   prone to typos."  Often pronounced with the first syllable
   lengthened, as /eeee'vil/.  Compare <b><a href="#evil%20and%20rude">evil and rude</a></b>.

<p><b>evil and rude</b> adj. <p>
 Both <b><a href="#evil">evil</a></b> and <b><a href="#rude">rude</a></b>, but with
   the additional connotation that the rudeness was due to malice
   rather than incompetence.  Thus, for example: Microsoft's Windows
   NT is <i>evil</i> because it's a competent implementation of a bad
   design; it's <i>rude</i> because it's gratuitously incompatible with
   Unix in places where compatibility would have been as easy and
   effective to do; but it's <i>evil and rude</i> because the
   incompatibilities are apparently there not to fix design bugs in
   Unix but rather to lock hapless customers and developers into the
   Microsoft way.  Hackish <i>evil and rude</i> is close to the
   mainstream sense of `evil'.

<p><b>EXCH</b> /eks'ch*/ or /eksch/ vt. <p>
 To exchange two things,
   each for the other; to swap places.  If you point to two people
   sitting down and say "Exch!", you are asking them to trade
   places.  EXCH, meaning EXCHange, was originally the name of a
   PDP-10 instruction that exchanged the contents of a register and a
   memory location.  Many newer hackers are probably thinking instead
   of the <b><a href="#PostScript">PostScript</a></b> exchange operator (which is usually written

 An executable
   binary file.  Some operating systems (notably MS-DOS, VMS, and

   also occasionally found among Unix programmers even though Unix
   executables don't have any required suffix.

<p><b>fall through</b> v. <p>
 (n. `fallthrough', var. 
   `fall-through') 1. To exit a loop by exhaustion, i.e., by having
   fulfilled its exit condition rather than via a break or exception
   condition that exits from the middle of it.  This usage appears to
   be <em>really</em> old, dating from the 1940s and 1950s.  2. To fail
   a test that would have passed control to a subroutine or some other
   distant portion of code.  3. In C, `fall-through' occurs when the
   flow of execution in a switch statement reaches a <code>case</code> label
   other than by jumping there from the switch header, passing a point
   where one would normally expect to find a <code>break</code>.  A trivial
   example:

<pre>switch (color)
{
case GREEN:
   do_green();
   break;
case PINK:
   do_pink();
   /* FALL THROUGH */
case RED:
   do_red();
   break;
default:
   do_blue();
   break;
}
</pre>

<p>The variant spelling <code>/* FALL THRU */</code> is also common.

<p>The effect of the above code is to <code>do_green()</code> when color is
   <code>GREEN</code>, <code>do_red()</code> when color is <code>RED</code>,
   <code>do_blue()</code> on any other color other than <code>PINK</code>, and
   (and this is the important part) <code>do_pink()</code> <em>and then</em>
   <code>do_red()</code> when color is <code>PINK</code>.  Fall-through is
   <b><a href="#considered%20harmful">considered harmful</a></b> by some, though there are contexts (such as
   the coding of state machines) in which it is natural; it is
   generally considered good practice to include a comment
   highlighting the fall-through where one would normally expect a
   break.  See also <b><a href="#Duff's%20device">Duff's device</a></b>.

 Without qualification, indicates a fan of science

   with other fans.  Many hackers are fans, so this term has been
   imported from fannish slang; however, unlike much fannish slang it

   plural is correctly `fen', but this usage is not automatic to

<p><b>fandango on core</b> n. <p>
 [Unix/C hackers, from the Iberian
   dance] In C, a wild pointer that runs out of bounds, causing a
   <b><a href="#core%20dump">core dump</a></b>, or corrupts the <code>malloc(3)</code> <b><a href="#arena">arena</a></b> in such
   a way as to cause mysterious failures later on, is sometimes said
   to have `done a fandango on core'.  On low-end personal machines
   without an MMU (or Windows boxes, which have an MMU but use it
   incompetently), this can corrupt the OS itself, causing massive
   lossage.  Other frenetic dances such as the cha-cha or the watusi, may
   be substituted.  See <b><a href="#aliasing%20bug">aliasing bug</a></b>, <b><a href="#precedence%20lossage">precedence lossage</a></b>,

<p><b>fascist</b> adj. <p>
 1. [common] Said of a computer system with
   excessive or annoying security barriers, usage limits, or access
   policies.  The implication is that said policies are preventing
   hackers from getting interesting work done.  The variant
   `fascistic' seems to have been preferred at MIT, poss. by analogy
   with `touristic' (see <b><a href="#tourist">tourist</a></b> or under the influence of
   German/Yiddish `faschistisch').  2. In the design of languages
   and other software tools, `the fascist alternative' is the most
   restrictive and structured way of capturing a particular function;
   the implication is that this may be desirable in order to simplify
   the implementation or provide tighter error checking.  Compare

<p><b>fat electrons</b> n. <p>
 Old-time hacker David Cargill's theory on
   the causation of computer glitches.  Your typical electric utility
   draws its line current out of the big generators with a pair of
   coil taps located near the top of the dynamo.  When the normal tap
   brushes get dirty, they take them off line to clean them up, and
   use special auxiliary taps on the <em>bottom</em> of the coil.  Now,
   this is a problem, because when they do that they get not ordinary
   or `thin' electrons, but the fat'n'sloppy electrons that are
   heavier and so settle to the bottom of the generator.  These flow
   down ordinary wires just fine, but when they have to turn a sharp
   corner (as in an integrated-circuit via), they're apt to get stuck. 
   This is what causes computer glitches.  [Fascinating.  Obviously,
   fat electrons must gain mass by <b><a href="#bogon">bogon</a></b> absorption --ESR]

<p><b>feature</b> n. <p>
 1. [common] A good property or behavior (as
   of a program).  Whether it was intended or not is immaterial. 
   2. [common] An intended property or behavior (as of a program). 
   Whether it is good or not is immaterial (but if bad, it is also a
   <b><a href="#misfeature">misfeature</a></b>).  3. A surprising property or behavior; in
   particular, one that is purposely inconsistent because it works
   better that way -- such an inconsistency is therefore a
   <b><a href="#feature">feature</a></b> and not a <b><a href="#bug">bug</a></b>.  This kind of feature is sometimes
   called a <b><a href="#miswart">miswart</a></b>; see that entry for a classic example.  4. A
   property or behavior that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though
   perhaps also impressive or cute.  For example, one feature of
   Common LISP's <code>format</code> function is the ability to print
   numbers in two different Roman-numeral formats (see <b><a href="#bells%20whistles%20and%20gongs">bells whistles and gongs</a></b>).  5. A property or behavior that was put in to
   help someone else but that happens to be in your way.  6. [common]
   A bug that has been documented.  To call something a feature
   sometimes means the author of the program did not consider the
   particular case, and that the program responded in a way that was
   unexpected but not strictly incorrect.  A standard joke is that a
   bug can be turned into a <b><a href="#feature">feature</a></b> simply by documenting it
   (then theoretically no one can complain about it because it's in
   the manual), or even by simply declaring it to be good.  "That's
   not a bug, that's a feature!" is a common catchphrase.  See also

<p>The relationship among bugs, features, misfeatures, warts, and
   miswarts might be clarified by the following hypothetical exchange
   between two hackers on an airliner:

<p>A: "This seat doesn't recline."

<p>B: "That's not a bug, that's a feature.  There is an emergency
   exit door built around the window behind you, and the route has to
   be kept clear."

<p>A: "Oh.  Then it's a misfeature; they should have increased the
   spacing between rows here."

<p>B: "Yes.  But if they'd increased spacing in only one section it
   would have been a wart -- they would've had to make
   nonstandard-length ceiling panels to fit over the displaced
   seats."

<p>A: "A miswart, actually.  If they increased spacing throughout
   they'd lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin.  So
   unequal spacing would actually be the Right Thing."

<p>B: "Indeed."

<p>`Undocumented feature' is a common, allegedly humorous euphemism
   for a <b><a href="#bug">bug</a></b>.  There's a related joke that is sometimes referred
   to as the "one-question geek test".  You say to someone "I saw a

<p><b>feature key</b> n. <p>
 [common] The Macintosh key with the
   cloverleaf graphic on its keytop; sometimes referred to as
   `flower', `pretzel', `clover', `propeller', `beanie' (an
   apparent reference to the major feature of a propeller beanie),
   <b><a href="#splat">splat</a></b>, `open-apple' or (officially, in Mac documentation)
   the `command key'. In French, the term `papillon' (butterfly)
   has been reported. The proliferation of terms for this creature
   may illustrate one subtle peril of iconic interfaces.

<p>Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that
   appears on the feature key.  Its oldest name is `cross of St. 
   Hannes', but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative
   motif.  Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to
   mark sites of historical interest.  Apple picked up the symbol from
   an early Mac developer who happened to be Swedish.  Apple
   documentation gives the translation "interesting feature"!

<p>There is some dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this
   symbol.  It technically stands for the word `sev&auml;rdhet' (thing
   worth seeing); many of these are old churches. Some Swedes report
   as an idiom for the sign the word `kyrka', cognate to English
   `church' and pronounced (roughly) /chur'ka/ in modern Swedish. 
   Others say this is nonsense.  Other idioms reported for the sign
   are `runa' (rune) or `runsten' /roon'stn/ (runestone),
   derived from the fact that many of the interesting features are
   Viking rune-stones.  The term `fornminne' /foorn'min'*/
   (relic of antiquity, ancient monument) is also reported, especially
   among those who think that the Mac itself is a relic of antiquity.

<p><b>featurectomy</b> /fee`ch*r-ek't*-mee/ n. <p>
 The act of removing
   a feature from a program.  Featurectomies come in two flavors, the
   `righteous' and the `reluctant'.  Righteous featurectomies are
   performed because the remover believes the program would be more
   elegant without the feature, or there is already an equivalent and
   better way to achieve the same end.  (Doing so is not quite the
   same thing as removing a <b><a href="#misfeature">misfeature</a></b>.)  Reluctant
   featurectomies are performed to satisfy some external constraint
   such as code size or execution speed.

 1. n. The soft electronic `bell' sound of a

   <b><a href="#beep">beep</a></b>, `bleep', or just about anything suitably onomatopoeic. 
   (Jeff MacNelly, in his comic strip "Shoe", uses the word
   `eep' for sounds made by computer terminals and video games; this
   is perhaps the closest written approximation yet.)  The term
   `breedle' was sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal
   bleepers are not particularly soft (they sound more like the
   musical equivalent of a raspberry or Bronx cheer; for a close
   approximation, imagine the sound of a Star Trek communicator's beep
   lasting for five seconds).  The `feeper' on a VT-52 has been

<p><b>fence</b> n. 1. <p>
 A sequence of one or more distinguished
   (<b><a href="#out-of-band">out-of-band</a></b>) characters (or other data items), used to
   delimit a piece of data intended to be treated as a unit (the
   computer-science literature calls this a `sentinel').  The NUL
   (ASCII 0000000) character that terminates strings in C is a fence. 
   Hex FF is also (though slightly less frequently) used this way. 
   See <b><a href="#zigamorph">zigamorph</a></b>.  2. An extra data value inserted in an array or
   other data structure in order to allow some normal test on the
   array's contents also to function as a termination test.  For
   example, a highly optimized routine for finding a value in an array
   might artificially place a copy of the value to be searched for
   after the last slot of the array, thus allowing the main search
   loop to search for the value without having to check at each pass
   whether the end of the array had been reached.  3. [among users of
   optimizing compilers] Any technique, usually exploiting knowledge
   about the compiler, that blocks certain optimizations.  Used when
   explicit mechanisms are not available or are overkill.  Typically a
   hack: "I call a dummy procedure there to force a flush of the
   optimizer's register-coloring info" can be expressed by the
   shorter "That's a fence procedure".

<p><b>fencepost error</b> n. <p>
 1. [common] A problem with the discrete
   equivalent of a boundary condition, often exhibited in programs by
   iterative loops.  From the following problem: "If you build a
   fence 100 feet long with posts 10 feet apart, how many posts do you
   need?"  (Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious 10.) 
   For example, suppose you have a long list or array of items, and
   want to process items m through n; how many items are
   there?  The obvious answer is n - m, but that is off by one;
   the right answer is n - m + 1.  A program that used the
   `obvious' formula would have a fencepost error in it.  See also
   <b><a href="#zeroth">zeroth</a></b> and <b><a href="#off-by-one%20error">off-by-one error</a></b>, and note that not all
   off-by-one errors are fencepost errors.  The game of Musical Chairs
   involves a catastrophic off-by-one error where N people try
   to sit in N - 1 chairs, but it's not a fencepost error. 
   Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces
   between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether
   one should count one or both ends of a row.  2. [rare] An error
   induced by unexpected regularities in input values, which can (for
   instance) completely thwart a theoretically efficient binary tree
   or hash table implementation.  (The error here involves the
   difference between expected and worst case behaviors of an
   algorithm.)

<p><b>filk</b> /filk/ n.,v. <p>
 [from SF fandom, where a typo for
   `folk' was adopted as a new word] Originally, a popular or folk
   song with lyrics revised or completely new lyrics and/or music,
   intended for humorous effect when read, and/or to be sung late at
   night at SF conventions.  More recently (especially since the late
   1980s), filk has come to include a great deal of
   originally-composed music on SFnal or fantasy themes and a range of
   moods wider than simple parody or humor.  Worthy of mention here
   because there is a flourishing subgenre of filks called `computer
   filks', written by hackers and often containing rather
   sophisticated technical humor.  See <b><a href="#double%20bucky">double bucky</a></b> for an
   example.  Compare <b><a href="#grilf">grilf</a></b>, <b><a href="#hing">hing</a></b>, <b><a href="#pr0n">pr0n</a></b>, and

<p><b>film at 11</b> <p>
 [MIT: in parody of TV newscasters] 1. Used in
   conversation to announce ordinary events, with a sarcastic
   implication that these events are earth-shattering.  "<b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b>
   crashes; film at 11."  "Bug found in scheduler; film at 11." 
   2. Also widely used outside MIT to indicate that additional
   information will be available at some future time, <em>without</em>
   the implication of anything particularly ordinary about the
   referenced event.  For example, "The mail file server died this
   morning; we found garbage all over the root directory.  Film at
   11." would indicate that a major failure had occurred but that the
   people working on it have no additional information about it as
   yet; use of the phrase in this way suggests gently that the problem
   is liable to be fixed more quickly if the people doing the fixing
   can spend time doing the fixing rather than responding to
   questions, the answers to which will appear on the normal "11:00
   news", if people will just be patient.

<p>The variant "MPEGs at 11" has recently been cited (MPEG is a
   digital-video format.)

<p><b>Finagle's Law</b> n. <p>
 The generalized or `folk' version of
   <b><a href="#Murphy's%20Law">Murphy's Law</a></b>, fully named "Finagle's Law of Dynamic
   Negatives" and usually rendered "Anything that can go wrong,
   will".  May have been first published by Francis P. Chisholm in
   his 1963 essay "The Chisholm Effect", later reprinted in the
   classic anthology "A Stress Analysis Of A Strapless Evening
   Gown: And Other Essays For A Scientific Eye" (Robert Baker ed,
   Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-852608-7).

<p>The label `Finagle's Law' was popularized by SF author
   Larry Niven in several stories depicting a frontier culture of
   asteroid miners; this `Belter' culture professed a religion
   and/or running joke involving the worship of the dread god Finagle
   and his mad prophet Murphy.  Some technical and scientific cultures
   (e.g., paleontologists) know it under the name `Sod's Law'; this
   usage may be more common in Great Britain.

<p>One variant favored among hackers is "The perversity of the
   Universe tends towards a maximum"; Niven specifically referred to
   this as O'Toole's Corollary of Finagle's Law.  See also

 1. The code you put in a system (say, a
   telephone switch) to make sure that the users can't do any
   damage. Since users always want to be able to do everything but
   never want to suffer for any mistakes, the construction of a
   firewall is a question not only of defensive coding but also of
   interface presentation, so that users don't even get curious about
   those corners of a system where they can burn themselves. 
   2. Any sanity check inserted to catch a <b><a href="#can't%20happen">can't happen</a></b> error. 
   Wise programmers often change code to fix a bug twice: once to fix
   the bug, and once to insert a firewall which would have arrested
   the bug before it did quite as much damage.

   <b><a href="#cracker">cracker</a></b>s.  The typical firewall is an inexpensive micro-based
   Unix box kept clean of critical data, with a bunch of modems and

   effects of a particularly serious crash which prevented the
   video pointer(s) from getting reset at the start of the vertical
   blank. This caused the DAC to scroll through the entire contents of
   CHIP (video or video+CPU) memory. Since each bit plane would scroll

<p><b>firmware</b> /ferm'weir/ n. <p>
 Embedded software contained

   doesn't have to be loaded from a disk like regular software. Hacker
   usage differs from straight techspeak in that hackers don't
   normally apply it to stuff that you can't possibly get at, such as
   the program that runs a pocket calculator. Instead, it implies that
   the firmware could be changed, even if doing so would mean opening
   a box and plugging in a new chip. A computer's BIOS is the classic
   example, although nowadays there is firmware in disk controllers,
   modems, video cards and even CD-ROM drives.

 A software change that is neither forward-

   code to the 1967 version (in draft at the time); this was scheduled
   for Flag Day (a U.S. holiday), June 14, 1966.  The actual change
   moved the code point for the ASCII newline character; this required

<p><b>flame</b> <p>
 [at MIT, orig. from the phrase `flaming asshole']
   1. vi. To post an email message intended to insult and provoke. 
   2. vi. To speak incessantly and/or rabidly on some relatively
   uninteresting subject or with a patently ridiculous attitude. 
   3. vt. Either of senses 1 or 2, directed with hostility at a
   particular person or people.  4. n. An instance of flaming. 
   When a discussion degenerates into useless controversy, one might
   tell the participants "Now you're just flaming" or "Stop all
   that flamage!" to try to get them to cool down (so to speak).

<p>The term may have been independently invented at several different
   places.  It has been reported from MIT, Carleton College and RPI
   (among many other places) from as far back as 1969, and from the
   University of Virginia in the early 1960s.

<p>It is possible that the hackish sense of `flame' is much older than
   that.  The poet Chaucer was also what passed for a wizard hacker in
   his time; he wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, the most advanced
   computing device of the day.  In Chaucer's "Troilus and
   Cressida", Cressida laments her inability to grasp the proof of a
   particular mathematical theorem; her uncle Pandarus then observes
   that it's called "the fleminge of wrecches."  This phrase seems
   to have been intended in context as "that which puts the wretches
   to flight" but was probably just as ambiguous in Middle English as
   "the flaming of wretches" would be today.  One suspects that
   Chaucer would feel right at home on Usenet.

<p><b>flap</b> vt. <p>

   attempting to flap device 0 would instead start a motor banging
   inside a cabinet near the disk.  2. By extension, to unload any

   longer actually flap, but the usage has remained.  (The term could
   well be re-applied to DEC's TK50 cartridge tape drive, a

   additional flavor".  "This convention yields additional flavor by
   allowing one to print text either right-side-up or upside-down." 
   See <b><a href="#vanilla">vanilla</a></b>.  This usage was certainly reinforced by the
   terminology of quantum chromodynamics, in which quarks (the
   constituents of, e.g., protons) come in six flavors (up, down,
   strange, charm, top, bottom) and three colors (red, blue, green)
   -- however, hackish use of `flavor' at MIT predated QCD. 
   3. The term for `class' (in the object-oriented sense) in the
   LISP Machine Flavors system.  Though the Flavors design has been
   superseded (notably by the Common LISP CLOS facility), the term
   `flavor' is still used as a general synonym for `class' by
   some LISP hackers.

<p><b>flowchart</b> n. <p>
 [techspeak] An archaic form of visual
   control-flow specification employing arrows and `speech
   balloons' of various shapes.  Hackers never use flowcharts,
   consider them extremely silly, and associate them with <b><a href="#COBOL">COBOL</a></b>
   programmers, <b><a href="#card%20walloper">card walloper</a></b>s, and other lower forms of life. 
   This attitude follows from the observations that flowcharts (at
   least from a hacker's point of view) are no easier to read than
   code, are less precise, and tend to fall out of sync with the code
   (so that they either obfuscate it rather than explaining it, or
   require extra maintenance effort that doesn't improve the code).

<p><b>flush</b> v. <p>
 1. [common] To delete something, usually
   superfluous, or to abort an operation.  "All that nonsense has
   been flushed."  2. [Unix/C] To force buffered I/O to disk, as with
   an <code>fflush(3)</code> call.  This is <em>not</em> an abort or deletion
   as in sense 1, but a demand for early completion!  3. To leave at
   the end of a day's work (as opposed to leaving for a meal).  "I'm
   going to flush now."  "Time to flush."  4. To exclude someone
   from an activity, or to ignore a person.

<p>`Flush' was standard ITS terminology for aborting an output
   operation; one spoke of the text that would have been printed, but
   was not, as having been flushed.  It is speculated that this term
   arose from a vivid image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing
   down the internal output buffer, washing the characters away before
   they could be printed.  The Unix/C usage, on the other hand, was
   propagated by the <code>fflush(3)</code> call in C's standard I/O library
   (though it is reported to have been in use among BLISS programmers
   at <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> and on Honeywell and IBM machines as far back as 1965). 
   Unix/C hackers found the ITS usage confusing, and vice versa.

   of the Jargon File interpreted this change as a post-war
   bowdlerization, but it it now seems more likely that FUBAR was
   itself a derivative of `foo' perhaps influenced by German
   `furchtbar' (terrible) - `foobar' may actually have been the
   <em>original</em> form.

<p>For, it seems, the word `foo' itself had an immediate prewar
   history in comic strips and cartoons.  The earliest documented uses
   were in the "Smokey Stover" comic strip published from about
   1930 to about 1952.  Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled
   it with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other
   nonsense phrases such as "Notary Sojac" and "1506 nix nix". 
   The word "foo" frequently appeared on license plates of
   cars, in nonsense sayings in the background of some frames (such as
   "He who foos last foos best" or "Many smoke but foo men chew"), and
   Holman had Smokey say "Where there's foo, there's fire".

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.spumco.com/magazine/eowbcc/">Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion</a> Holman claimed to have found the
   word "foo" on the bottom of a Chinese figurine.  This is
   plausible; Chinese statuettes often have apotropaic inscriptions,
   and this may have been the Chinese word `fu' (sometimes
   transliterated `foo'), which can mean "happiness" or
   "prosperity" when spoken with the proper tone (the lion-dog
   guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese restaurants are
   properly called "fu dogs").  English speakers' reception of
   Holman's `foo' nonsense word was undoubtedly influenced by Yiddish
   `feh' and English `fooey' and `fool'.

<p>Holman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode
   on two wheels.  The comic strip was tremendously popular in the
   late 1930s, and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even
   produced an operable version of Holman's Foomobile.  According to
   the Encyclopedia of American Comics, `Foo' fever swept the U.S.,
   finding its way into popular songs and generating over 500 `Foo
   Clubs.'  The fad left `foo' references embedded in popular culture
   (including a couple of appearances in Warner Brothers cartoons of
   1938-39; notably in Robert Clampett's "Daffy Doc" of 1938, in
   which a very early version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying
   "SILENCE IS FOO!")  When the fad faded, the origin of "foo" was
   forgotten.

<p>One place "foo" is known to have remained live is in the
   U.S. military during the WWII years.  In 1944-45, the term `foo
   fighters' was in use by radar operators for the kind of mysterious
   or spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the older term
   resurfaced in popular American usage in 1995 via the name of one of
   the better grunge-rock bands).  Because informants connected the
   term directly to the Smokey Stover strip, the folk etymology that
   connects it to French "feu" (fire) can be gently dismissed.

<p>The U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped slang terms
   during the war (see <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b> and <b><a href="#kludge">kludge</a></b> for another
   important example) Period sources reported that `FOO' became a
   semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army graffiti more or less
   equivalent to the American Kilroy.  Where British troops went, the
   graffito "FOO was here" or something similar showed up.  Several
   slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came from Forward
   Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous "FUBAR")
   was probably a <b><a href="#backronym">backronym</a></b> .  Forty years later, Paul Dickson's
   excellent book "Words" (Dell, 1982, ISBN 0-440-52260-7) traced
   "Foo" to an unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting
   as follows: "Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product,
   gifted with bitter omniscience and sarcasm."

<p>Earlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that
   hacker usage actually sprang from "FOO, Lampoons and Parody",
   the title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint
   project of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in
   his mid-teens) later became one of the most important and
   influential artists in underground comics, this venture was hardly
   a success; indeed, the brothers later burned most of the existing
   copies in disgust.  The title FOO was featured in large letters on
   the front cover.  However, very few copies of this comic actually
   circulated, and students of Crumb's `oeuvre' have established
   that this title was a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover
   comics.  The Crumbs may also have been influenced by a short-lived
   Canadian parody magazine named `Foo' published in 1951-52.

<p>An old-time member reports that in the 1959 "Dictionary of the
   TMRC Language", compiled at <b><a href="#TMRC">TMRC</a></b>, there was an entry that went
   something like this:

<blockquote>
FOO: The first syllable of the sacred chant phrase "FOO MANE PADME
HUM."  Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning. 
</blockquote>

<p>(For more about the legendary foo counters, see <b><a href="#TMRC">TMRC</a></b>.)  This
   definition used Bill Holman's nonsense word, only then two decades
   old and demonstrably still live in popular culture and slang, to a
   <b><a href="#ha%20ha%20only%20serious">ha ha only serious</a></b> analogy with esoteric Tibetan Buddhism. 
   Today's hackers would find it difficult to resist elaborating a
   joke like that, and it is not likely 1959's were any less
   susceptible. Almost the entire staff of what later became the MIT
   AI Lab was involved with TMRC, and the word spread from there.

<p><b>Foonly</b> n. <p>
 1. The <b><a href="#PDP-10">PDP-10</a></b> successor that was to have
   been built by the Super Foonly project at the Stanford Artificial
   Intelligence Laboratory along with a new operating system. 
   (The name itself came from FOO NLI, an error message emitted by a
   PDP-10 assembler at SAIL meaning "FOO is Not a Legal Identifier". 
   The intention was to leapfrog from the old <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> timesharing system SAIL
   was then running to a new generation, bypassing TENEX which at that
   time was the ARPANET standard.  ARPA funding for both the Super
   Foonly and the new operating system was cut in 1974.  Most of the
   design team went to DEC and contributed greatly to the design of
   the PDP-10 model KL10.  2. The name of the company formed by Dave
   Poole, one of the principal Super Foonly designers, and one of
   hackerdom's more colorful personalities.  Many people remember the
   parrot which sat on Poole's shoulder and was a regular companion. 
   3. Any of the machines built by Poole's company.  The first was the
   F-1 (a.k.a.  Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used
   to create the graphics in the movie "TRON".  The F-1 was the
   fastest PDP-10 ever built, but only one was ever made.  The effort
   drained Foonly of its financial resources, and the company turned
   towards building smaller, slower, and much less expensive machines. 
   Unfortunately, these ran not the popular <b><a href="#TOPS-20">TOPS-20</a></b> but a TENEX
   variant called Foonex; this seriously limited their market.  Also,
   the machines shipped were actually wire-wrapped engineering
   prototypes requiring individual attention from more than usually
   competent site personnel, and thus had significant reliability
   problems.  Poole's legendary temper and unwillingness to suffer
   fools gladly did not help matters.  By the time of the Jupiter
   project cancellation in 1983, Foonly's proposal to build another
   F-1 was eclipsed by the <b><a href="#Mars">Mars</a></b>, and the company never quite
   recovered.  See the <b><a href="#Mars">Mars</a></b> entry for the continuation and moral

   how far that user can go before the program begins to get in the

<p><b>for values of</b> <p>
 [MIT] A common rhetorical maneuver at MIT is
   to use any of the canonical <b><a href="#random%20numbers">random numbers</a></b> as placeholders for
   variables.  "The max function takes 42 arguments, for arbitrary
   values of 42." "There are 69 ways to leave your lover, for 69 =
   50."  This is especially likely when the speaker has uttered a
   random number and realizes that it was not recognized as such, but
   even `non-random' numbers are occasionally used in this fashion. 
   A related joke is that pi equals 3 -- for small values
   of pi and large values of 3.

<p>Historical note: at MIT this usage has traditionally been traced to
   the programming language MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder), an
   Algol-58-like language that was the most common choice among
   mainstream (non-hacker) users at MIT in the mid-60s.  It inherited
   from Algol-58 a control structure FOR VALUES OF X = 3, 7, 99 DO
   ... that would repeat the indicated instructions for each value in
   the list (unlike the usual FOR that only works for arithmetic
   sequences of values).  MAD is long extinct, but similar
   for-constructs still flourish (e.g., in Unix's shell languages).

<p><b>fork</b> <p>
 In the open-source community, a fork is what occurs
   when two (or more) versions of a software package's source code are
   being developed in parallel which once shared a common code base,
   and these multiple versions of the source code have
   irreconcilable differences between them.  This should not be
   confused with a development branch, which may later be folded back
   into the original source code base.  Nor should it be confused
   with what happens when a new distribution of Linux or some other
   distribution is created, because that largely assembles pieces than
   can and will be used in other distributions without conflict.

<p>Forking is uncommon; in fact, it is so uncommon that individual
   instances loom large in hacker folklore.  Notable in this class
   were the <a href="Emacs/XEmacs fork">http://www.xemacs.org/About/XEmacsVsGNUemacs.html</a>, the GCC/EGCS
   fork (later healed by a merger) and the forks among the FreeBSD,
   NetBSD, and OpenBSD operating systems.

 [Unix] A particular species of <b><a href="#wabbit">wabbit</a></b>

   process `explodes' by recursively spawning copies of itself
   (using the Unix system call <code>fork(2)</code>).  Eventually it eats
   all the process table entries and effectively wedges the system. 
   Fortunately, fork bombs are relatively easy to spot and kill, so
   creating one deliberately seldom accomplishes more than to bring

 1. [common after 1997, esp. in the Linux
   community] An open-source software project is said to have forked
   or be forked when the project group fissions into two or more parts
   pursuing separate lines of development (or, less commonly, when a
   third party unconnected to the project group begins its own line of
   development).  Forking is considered a <b><a href="#Bad%20Thing">Bad Thing</a></b> - not merely
   because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but
   because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and
   acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy,
   succession, and design direction.  There is serious social pressure
   against forking.  As a result, major forks (such as the
   Gnu-Emacs/XEmacs split, the fissionings of the 386BSD group into
   three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are
   rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker
   folklore.  2. [Unix; uncommon; prob. influenced by a mainstream

   is in fact as superficial as possible without being totally
   <b><a href="#content-free">content-free</a></b>.  "Forget the four-color glossies, give me the
   tech ref manuals."  Often applied as an indication of
   superficiality even when the material is printed on ordinary paper
   in black and white.  Four-color-glossy manuals are <em>never</em>
   useful for solving a problem.  2. [rare] Applied by extension to
   manual pages that don't contain enough information to diagnose why
   the program doesn't produce the expected or desired output.

<p><b>Frankenputer</b> n. <p>
 1. A mostly-working computer thrown
   together from the spare parts of several machines out of which the
   <b><a href="#magic%20smoke">magic smoke</a></b> had been let.  Most shops have a closet full of
   nonworking machines.  When a new machine is needed immediately (for
   testing, for example) and there is no time (or budget) to
   requisition a new box, someone (often an intern) is tasked with
   building a Frankenputer. 2.  Also used in referring to a machine
   that once was a name-brand computer, but has been upgraded long
   beyond its useful life, to the point at which the nameplate
   violates truth-in-advertising laws (e.g., a Pentium II-class
   machine inexplicably living in a case marked "Gateway 486/66").

<p><b>free software</b> n. <p>
 As defined by Richard M. Stallman and
   used by the Free Software movement, this means software that gives
   users enough freedom to be used by the free software community. 
   Specifically, users must be free to modify the software for their
   private use, and free to redistribute it either with or without
   modifications, either commercially or noncommercially, either
   gratis or charging a distribution fee.  Free software has existed
   since the dawn of computing; Free Software as a movement began in
   1984 with the GNU Project.

<p>RMS observes that the English word "free" can refer either to
   liberty (where it means the same as the Spanish or French
   "libre") or to price (where it means the same as the Spanish
   "gratis" or French "gratuit").  RMS and other people associated
   with the FSF like to explain the word "free" in "free software"
   by saying "Free as an speech, not as in beer."

<p>See also <b><a href="#open%20source">open source</a></b>.  Hard-core proponents of the term "free
   software" sometimes reject this newer term, claiming that the style of
   argument associated with it ignores or downplays the moral
   imperative at the heart of free software.

 [common] Free software, often written by
   enthusiasts and distributed by users' groups, or via electronic
   mail, local bulletin boards, <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b>, or other electronic
   media.  At one time, `freeware' was a trademark of Andrew
   Fluegelman, the author of the well-known MS-DOS comm program
   PC-TALK III.  It wasn't enforced after his mysterious
   disappearance and presumed death in 1984.  See <b><a href="#shareware">shareware</a></b>,

<p><b>freeze</b> v. <p>
 To lock an evolving software distribution or
   document against changes so it can be released with some hope of
   stability.  Carries the strong implication that the item in
   question will `unfreeze' at some future date.  "OK, fix that
   bug and we'll freeze for release."

<p>There are more specific constructions on this term.  A `feature
   freeze', for example, locks out modifications intended to introduce
   new features but still allows bugfixes and completion of existing
   features; a `code freeze' connotes no more changes at all.  At
   Sun Microsystems and elsewhere, one may also hear references to
   `code slush' -- that is, an almost-but-not-quite frozen state.

   used metaphorically.)  Compare <b><a href="#frotzed">frotzed</a></b>.  2. [common] Of
   people, exhausted.  Said particularly of those who continue to work
   in such a state.  Often used as an explanation or excuse.  "Yeah,
   I know that fix destroyed the file system, but I was fried when I
   put it in."  Esp. common in conjunction with `brain': "My

<p><b>frob</b> /frob/ 1. n. <p>
 [MIT; very common] The <b><a href="#TMRC">TMRC</a></b>
   definition was "FROB = a protruding arm or trunnion"; by
   metaphoric extension, a `frob' is any random small thing; an
   object that you can comfortably hold in one hand; something you can
   frob (sense 2).  See <b><a href="#frobnitz">frobnitz</a></b>.  2. vt.  Abbreviated form
   of <b><a href="#frobnicate">frobnicate</a></b>.  3. [from the <b><a href="#MUD">MUD</a></b> world] A command on some
   MUDs that changes a player's experience level (this can be used to
   make wizards); also, to request <b><a href="#wizard">wizard</a></b> privileges on the
   `professional courtesy' grounds that one is a wizard elsewhere. 
   The command is actually `frobnicate' but is universally abbreviated
   to the shorter form.

<p><b>frobnicate</b> /frob'ni-kayt/ vt. <p>
 [Poss. derived from
   <b><a href="#frobnitz">frobnitz</a></b>, and usually abbreviated to <b><a href="#frob">frob</a></b>, but
   `frobnicate' is recognized as the official full form.] To
   manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  One frequently frobs bits or other
   2-state devices.  Thus: "Please frob the light switch" (that is,
   flip it), but also "Stop frobbing that clasp; you'll break it". 
   One also sees the construction `to frob a frob'.  See <b><a href="#tweak">tweak</a></b>
   and <b><a href="#twiddle">twiddle</a></b>.

<p>Usage: frob, twiddle, and tweak sometimes connote points along a
   continuum.  `Frob' connotes aimless manipulation; `twiddle'
   connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper
   setting; `tweak' connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is turning a
   knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it, he is
   probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the
   screen, he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it
   because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.  The variant
   `frobnosticate' has been recently reported.

<p><b>frobnitz</b> /frob'nits/, pl. `frobnitzem' /frob'nit-zm/ or
   `frobni' /frob'ni:/ n. <p>
 [TMRC] An unspecified physical
   object, a widget.  Also refers to electronic black boxes.  This
   rare form is usually abbreviated to `frotz', or more commonly to
   <b><a href="#frob">frob</a></b>.  Also used are `frobnule' (/frob'n[y]ool/) and
   `frobule' (/frob'yool/).  Starting perhaps in 1979, `frobozz'
   /fr*-boz'/ (plural: `frobbotzim' /fr*-bot'zm/) has also
   become very popular, largely through its exposure as a name via
   <b><a href="#Zork">Zork</a></b>.  These variants can also be applied to nonphysical
   objects, such as data structures.  For related amusement, see
   the
   <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Encyclopedia%20Frobozzica&amp;lastnode_id=585787">Encyclopedia Frobozzica</a>.

<p>Pete Samson, compiler of the original <b><a href="#TMRC">TMRC</a></b> lexicon, adds,
   "Under the TMRC [railroad] layout were many storage boxes, managed
   (in 1958) by David R. Sawyer.  Several had fanciful designations
   written on them, such as `Frobnitz Coil Oil'.  Perhaps DRS intended
   Frobnitz to be a proper name, but the name was quickly taken for
   the thing".  This was almost certainly the origin of the
   term.

<p><b>frogging</b> [University of Waterloo] v. <p>
 1. Partial corruption
   of a text file or input stream by some bug or consistent glitch, as
   opposed to random events like line noise or media failures.  Might
   occur, for example, if one bit of each incoming character on a tty
   were stuck, so that some characters were correct and others were
   not.  See <b><a href="#terminak">terminak</a></b> for a historical example and compare
   <b><a href="#dread%20high-bit%20disease">dread high-bit disease</a></b>.  2. By extension, accidental display
   of text in a mode where the output device emits special symbols or
   mnemonics rather than conventional ASCII.  This often happens, for
   example, when using a terminal or comm program on a device like an
   IBM PC with a special `high-half' character set and with the
   bit-parity assumption wrong.  A hacker sufficiently familiar with
   ASCII bit patterns might be able to read the display anyway.

<p><b>FRS</b> // n.,obs. <p>
 Abbreviation for "Freely Redistributable
   Software" which entered general use on the Internet in 1995 after
   years of low-level confusion over what exactly to call software
   written to be passed around and shared (contending terms including
   <b><a href="#freeware">freeware</a></b>, <b><a href="#shareware">shareware</a></b>, and `sourceware' were never
   universally felt to be satisfactory for various subtle reasons). 
   The first formal conference on freely redistributable software was
   held in Cambridge, Massachussetts, in February 1996 (sponsored by the
   Free Software Foundation). The conference organizers used the FRS
   abbreviation heavily in its calls for papers and other literature
   during 1995. The term was in steady though not common use until
   1998 and the invention of <b><a href="#open%20source">open source</a></b>, after which it became

<p><b>fuck me harder</b> excl. <p>
 Sometimes uttered in response to
   egregious misbehavior, esp. in software, and esp. of
   misbehaviors which seem unfairly persistent (as though designed in
   by the imp of the perverse).  Often theatrically elaborated:
   "Aiighhh! Fuck me with a piledriver and 16 feet of curare-tipped
   wrought-iron fence <em>and no lubricants</em>!" The phrase is
   sometimes heard abbreviated `FMH' in polite company.

<p>[This entry is an extreme example of the hackish habit of coining
   elaborate and evocative terms for lossage. Here we see a quite
   self-conscious parody of mainstream expletives that has become a
   running gag in part of the hacker culture; it illustrates the
   hackish tendency to turn any situation, even one of extreme
   frustration, into an intellectual game (the point being, in this
   case, to creatively produce a long-winded description of the
   most anatomically absurd mental image possible -- the short forms
   implicitly allude to all the ridiculous long forms ever spoken). 
   Scatological language is actually relatively uncommon among
   hackers, and there was some controversy over whether this entry
   ought to be included at all.  As it reflects a live usage
   recognizably peculiar to the hacker culture, we feel it is
   in the hackish spirit of truthfulness and opposition to all
   forms of censorship to record it here. --ESR &amp; GLS]

<p><b>FUD</b> /fuhd/ n. <p>
 Defined by Gene Amdahl after he left IBM to
   found his own company: "FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt
   that IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers
   who might be considering [Amdahl] products."  The idea, of course,
   was to persuade them to go with safe IBM gear rather than with
   competitors' equipment.  This implicit coercion was traditionally
   accomplished by promising that Good Things would happen to people
   who stuck with IBM, but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of
   competitors' equipment or software.  See <b><a href="#IBM">IBM</a></b>.  After 1990
   the term FUD was associated increasingly frequently with
   <b><a href="#Microsoft">Microsoft</a></b>, and has become generalized to refer to any kind of
   disinformation used as a competitive weapon.

<p><b>fudge factor</b> n. <p>
 [common] A value or parameter that is
   varied in an ad hoc way to produce the desired result.  The terms
   `tolerance' and <b><a href="#slop">slop</a></b> are also used, though these usually
   indicate a one-sided leeway, such as a buffer that is made larger
   than necessary because one isn't sure exactly how large it needs to
   be, and it is better to waste a little space than to lose
   completely for not having enough.  A fudge factor, on the other
   hand, can often be tweaked in more than one direction.  A good
   example is the `fuzz' typically allowed in floating-point
   calculations: two numbers being compared for equality must be
   allowed to differ by a small amount; if that amount is too small, a
   computation may never terminate, while if it is too large, results
   will be needlessly inaccurate.  Fudge factors are frequently
   adjusted incorrectly by programmers who don't fully understand
   their import.  See also <b><a href="#coefficient%20of%20X">coefficient of X</a></b>.

 Said of something that functions, but in a

   difficult to change, so its obvious non-optimality is left alone. 
   Often used to describe interfaces.  The more bugs something has
   that nobody has bothered to fix because workarounds are easier, the
   funkier it is.  <b><a href="#TECO">TECO</a></b> and UUCP are funky.  The Intel i860's

<p><b>funny money</b> n. <p>
 1. Notional `dollar' units of computing
   time and/or storage handed to students at the beginning of a
   computer course; also called `play money' or `purple money' (in
   implicit opposition to real or `green' money).  In New Zealand
   and Germany the odd usage `paper money' has been recorded; in
   Germany, the particularly amusing synonym `transfer ruble'
   commemmorates the funny money used for trade between COMECON
   countries back when the Soviet Bloc still existed.  When your funny
   money ran out, your account froze and you needed to go to a
   professor to get more.  Fortunately, the plunging cost of
   timesharing cycles has made this less common.  The amounts
   allocated were almost invariably too small, even for the
   non-hackers who wanted to slide by with minimum work.  In extreme
   cases, the practice led to small-scale black markets in bootlegged
   computer accounts.  2. By extension, phantom money or quantity
   tickets of any kind used as a resource-allocation hack within a
   system.  Antonym: `real money'.

 [Commodore BBS culture] Any file that is written

   such as the Jargon File, documentation, humor files, hacker lore,
   and technical materials.

<p>This term survives from the nearly forgotten Commodore 64
   underground and BBS community. In the early 80s, C-Net had emerged
   as the most popular C64 BBS software for systems which encouraged
   messaging (as opposed to file transfer).  There were three main
   options for files: Program files (p-files), which served the same
   function as `doors' in today's systems, UD files (the user
   upload/download section), and g-files.  Anything that was meant to
   be read was included in g-files.

   quantities, thereby exterminating the source of irritation.  "Some
   loser just reloaded the system for no reason!  Gas!"  2. interj. A
   suggestion that someone or something ought to be flushed out of
   mercy.  "The system's getting <b><a href="#wedged">wedged</a></b> every few minutes. 
   Gas!"  3. vt.  To <b><a href="#flush">flush</a></b> (sense 1).  "You should gas that old
   crufty software."  4. [IBM] n. Dead space in nonsequentially
   organized files that was occupied by data that has since been
   deleted; the compression operation that removes it is called
   `degassing' (by analogy, perhaps, with the use of the same term
   in vacuum technology).  5. [IBM] n. Empty space on a disk that has
   been clandestinely allocated against future need.

<p><b>Gates's Law</b> <p>
 "The speed of software halves every 18
   months." This oft-cited law is an ironic comment on the tendency
   of software bloat to outpace the every-18-month doubling in
   hardware caopacity per dollar predicted by <b><a href="#Moore's%20Law">Moore's Law</a></b>. The
   reference is to Bill Gates; Microsoft is widely considered among
   the worst if not the worst of the perpetrators of bloat.

<p><b>GC</b> /G-C/ <p>
 [from LISP terminology; `Garbage Collect']
   1. vt. To clean up and throw away useless things.  "I think I'll
   GC the top of my desk today."  When said of files, this is
   equivalent to <b><a href="#GFR">GFR</a></b>.  2. vt. To recycle, reclaim, or put to

   process.

<p>`Garbage collection' is computer-science techspeak for a
   particular class of strategies for dynamically but transparently
   reallocating computer memory (i.e., without requiring explicit
   allocation and deallocation by higher-level software).  One such
   strategy involves periodically scanning all the data in memory and
   determining what is no longer accessible; useless data items are
   then discarded so that the memory they occupy can be recycled and
   used for another purpose.  Implementations of the LISP language
   usually use garbage collection.

<p>In jargon, the full phrase is sometimes heard but the <b><a href="#abbrev">abbrev</a></b>
   GC is more frequently used because it is shorter.  Note that there
   is an ambiguity in usage that has to be resolved by context: "I'm
   going to garbage-collect my desk" usually means to clean out the
   drawers, but it could also mean to throw away or recycle the desk
   itself.

 A <b><a href="#quick-and-dirty">quick-and-dirty</a></b> <b><a href="#clone">clone</a></b>
   of System/360 DOS that emerged from GE around 1970; originally
   called GECOS (the General Electric Comprehensive Operating System). 
   Later kluged to support primitive timesharing and transaction
   processing.  After the buyout of GE's computer division by
   Honeywell, the name was changed to General Comprehensive Operating
   System (GCOS).  Other OS groups at Honeywell began referring to it
   as `God's Chosen Operating System', allegedly in reaction to the
   GCOS crowd's uninformed and snotty attitude about the superiority
   of their product.  All this might be of zero interest, except for
   two facts: (1) The GCOS people won the political war, and this led
   in the orphaning and eventual death of Honeywell <b><a href="#Multics">Multics</a></b>, and
   (2) GECOS/GCOS left one permanent mark on Unix.  Some early Unix
   systems at Bell Labs used GCOS machines for print spooling and
   various other services; the field added to <code>/etc/passwd</code> to
   carry GCOS ID information was called the `GECOS field' and
   survives today as the <code>pw_gecos</code> member used for the user's
   full name and other human-ID information.  GCOS later played a
   major role in keeping Honeywell a dismal also-ran in the mainframe
   market, and was itself mostly ditched for Unix in the late 1980s
   when Honeywell began to retire its aging <b><a href="#big%20iron">big iron</a></b> designs.

<p><b>gedanken</b> /g*-dahn'kn/ adj. <p>
 Ungrounded; impractical; not
   well-thought-out; untried; untested.

<p>`Gedanken' is a German word for `thought'.  A thought
   experiment is one you carry out in your head.  In physics, the term
   `gedanken experiment' is used to refer to an experiment that is
   impractical to carry out, but useful to consider because it can
   be reasoned about theoretically.  (A classic gedanken experiment of
   relativity theory involves thinking about a man in an elevator
   accelerating through space.)  Gedanken experiments are very useful
   in physics, but must be used with care.  It's too easy to idealize
   away some important aspect of the real world in constructing the
   `apparatus'.

<p>Among hackers, accordingly, the word has a pejorative connotation. 
   It is typically used of a project, especially one in artificial
   intelligence research, that is written up in grand detail
   (typically as a Ph.D.  thesis) without ever being implemented to
   any great extent.  Such a project is usually perpetrated by people
   who aren't very good hackers or find programming distasteful or are
   just in a hurry.  A `gedanken thesis' is usually marked by an
   obvious lack of intuition about what is programmable and what is
   not, and about what does and does not constitute a clear
   specification of an algorithm.  See also <b><a href="#AI-complete">AI-complete</a></b>,

<p><b>geek</b> <p>
 n. <p>
 A person who has chosen concentration
   rather than conformity; one who pursues skill (especially technical
   skill) and imagination, not mainstream social acceptance.  Geeks
   usually have a strong case of <b><a href="#neophilia">neophilia</a></b>. Most geeks are adept
   with computers and treat <b><a href="#hacker">hacker</a></b> as a term of respect, but not
   all are hackers themselves - and some who <em>are</em> in fact
   hackers normally call themselves geeks anyway, because they (quite
   properly) regard `hacker' as a label that should be bestowed by
   others rather than self-assumed.

<p>One <a href="http://www.darkwater.com/omni/geek.html">description</a>
   accurately if a little breathlessly enumerates "gamers, ravers,
   science fiction fans, punks, perverts, programmers, nerds,
   subgenii, and trekkies. These are people who did not go to their
   high school proms, and many would be offended by the suggestion
   that they should have even wanted to."

<p>Originally, a `geek' was a carnival performer who bit the heads
   off chickens.  Before about 1990 usage of this term was rather
   negative.  Earlier versions of this lexicon defined a `computer
   geek' as one who eats (computer) bugs for a living - an asocial,
   malodorous, pasty-faced monomaniac with all the personality of a
   cheese grater.  This is often still the way geeks are regarded by
   non-geeks, but as the mainstream culture becomes more dependent on
   technology and technical skill mainstream attitudes have tended to
   shift towards grudging respect.  Correspondingly, there are now
   `geek pride' festivals (the implied reference to `gay pride' is not
   accidental).

   codes commonly used in <b><a href="#sig%20block">sig block</a></b>s to broadcast the interests,
   skills, and aspirations of the poster.  Features a G at the left

   a `male homosexual adapter' has pins on both sides (is doubly
   male) or sockets on both sides (connects two males).

<p><b>General Public Virus</b> n. <p>
 Pejorative name for some
   versions of the <b><a href="#GNU">GNU</a></b> project <b><a href="#copyleft">copyleft</a></b> or General Public
   License (GPL), which requires that any tools or <b><a href="#app">app</a></b>s
   incorporating copylefted code must be source-distributed on the
   same anti-proprietary terms as GNU stuff.  Thus it is alleged
   that the copyleft `infects' software generated with GNU tools,
   which may in turn infect other software that reuses any of its
   code.  The Free Software Foundation's official position as of
   January 1991 is that copyright law limits the scope of the GPL to
   "programs textually incorporating significant amounts of GNU
   code", and that the `infection' is not passed on to third
   parties unless actual GNU source is transmitted.  Nevertheless,
   widespread suspicion that the <b><a href="#copyleft">copyleft</a></b> language is
   `boobytrapped' has caused many developers to avoid using GNU
   tools and the GPL.  Changes in the language of the version 2.0
   GPL did not eliminate this problem.

<p><b>glark</b> /glark/ vt. <p>
 To figure something out from context. 
   "The System III manuals are pretty poor, but you can generally
   glark the meaning from context."  Interestingly, the word was
   originally `glork'; the context was "This gubblick contains many
   nonsklarkish English flutzpahs, but the overall pluggandisp can be
   glorked [sic] from context" (David Moser, quoted by Douglas
   Hofstadter in his "Metamagical Themas" column in the January
   1981 "Scientific American").  It is conjectured that hacker
   usage mutated the verb to `glark' because <b><a href="#glork">glork</a></b> was already

<p><b>glitch</b> /glich/ <p>
 [very common; from German `glitschig'
   slippery, via Yiddish `glitshen', to slide or skid] 1. n. A
   sudden interruption in electric service, sanity, continuity, or
   program function.  Sometimes recoverable.  An interruption in
   electric service is specifically called a `power glitch' (also
   <b><a href="#power%20hit">power hit</a></b>), of grave concern because it usually crashes all
   the computers.  In jargon, though, a hacker who got to the middle
   of a sentence and then forgot how he or she intended to complete it
   might say, "Sorry, I just glitched".  2. vi. To commit a
   glitch.  See <b><a href="#gritch">gritch</a></b>.  3. vt.  [Stanford] To scroll a
   display screen, esp. several lines at a time.  <b><a href="#WAITS">WAITS</a></b>
   terminals used to do this in order to avoid continuous scrolling,
   which is distracting to the eye.  4. obs.  Same as <b><a href="#magic%20cookie">magic cookie</a></b>, sense 2.

<p>All these uses of `glitch' derive from the specific technical
   meaning the term has in the electronic hardware world, where it is
   now techspeak.  A glitch can occur when the inputs of a circuit
   change, and the outputs change to some <b><a href="#random">random</a></b> value for some
   very brief time before they settle down to the correct value.  If
   another circuit inspects the output at just the wrong time, reading
   the random value, the results can be very wrong and very hard to
   debug (a glitch is one of many causes of electronic <b><a href="#heisenbug">heisenbug</a></b>s).

<p><b>glob</b> /glob/, <em>not</em> /glohb/ v.,n. <p>
 [Unix;
   common] To expand special characters in a wildcarded name, or the
   act of so doing (the action is also called `globbing').  The Unix
   conventions for filename wildcarding have become sufficiently
   pervasive that many hackers use some of them in written English,
   especially in email or news on technical topics.  Those commonly
   encountered include the following:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><tt>*</tt>
<dd>wildcard for any string (see also <b><a href="#UN*X">UN*X</a></b>)

<dt><tt>?</tt>
<dd>wildcard for any single character (generally read this way only at the
beginning or in the middle of a word)

<dt><tt>[]</tt>
<dd>delimits a wildcard matching any of the enclosed characters

<dt><tt>{}</tt>
<dd>alternation of comma-separated alternatives; thus, `foo{baz,qux}'
would be read as `foobaz' or `fooqux'
</dl>
</blockquote>


<br><p>
<p>Some examples: "He said his name was [KC]arl" (expresses
   ambiguity).  "I don't read talk.politics.*" (any of the
   talk.politics subgroups on <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b>).  Other examples are given
   under the entry for <b><a href="#X">X</a></b>.  Note that glob patterns are similar,
   but not identical, to those used in <b><a href="#regexp">regexp</a></b>s.

<p>Historical note: The jargon usage derives from <code>glob</code>, the
   name of a subprogram that expanded wildcards in archaic pre-Bourne
   versions of the Unix shell.

   remains controversial (because it implicitly denies any right of

<p><b>golf-ball printer</b> n. obs. <p>
 The IBM 2741, a slow but
   letter-quality printing device and terminal based on the IBM
   Selectric typewriter.  The `golf ball' was a little spherical
   frob bearing reversed embossed images of 88 different characters
   arranged on four parallels of latitude; one could change the font
   by swapping in a different golf ball.  The print element spun and
   jerked alarmingly in action and when in motion was sometimes
   described as an `infuriated golf ball'.  This was the technology
   that enabled APL to use a non-EBCDIC, non-ASCII, and in fact
   completely non-standard character set.  This put it 10 years ahead
   of its time -- where it stayed, firmly rooted, for the next 20,
   until character displays gave way to programmable bit-mapped
   devices with the flexibility to support other character sets.

<p><b>gopher</b> n. <p>
 A type of Internet service first floated around
   1991 and obsolesced around 1995 by the World Wide Web. Gopher
   presents a menuing interface to a tree or graph of links;
   the links can be to documents, runnable programs, or other gopher
   menus arbitrarily far across the net.

<p>Some claim that the gopher software, which was originally developed
   at the University of Minnesota, was named after the Minnesota
   Gophers (a sports team).  Others claim the word derives from
   American slang `gofer' (from "go for", dialectal "go fer"),
   one whose job is to run and fetch things.  Finally, observe that
   gophers dig long tunnels, and the idea of tunneling through the net
   to find information was a defining metaphor for the developers. 
   Probably all three things were true, but with the first two coming
   first and the gopher-tunnel metaphor serendipitously adding flavor
   and impetus to the project as it developed out of its concept
   stage.

<p><b>gorilla arm</b> n. <p>
 The side-effect that destroyed touch-screens
   as a mainstream input technology despite a promising start in the
   early 1980s.  It seems the designers of all those <b><a href="#spiffy">spiffy</a></b>
   touch-menu systems failed to notice that humans aren't designed to
   hold their arms in front of their faces making small motions. 
   After more than a very few selections, the arm begins to feel sore,
   cramped, and oversized -- the operator looks like a gorilla while
   using the touch screen and feels like one afterwards.  This is now
   considered a classic cautionary tale to human-factors designers;
   "Remember the gorilla arm!" is shorthand for "How is this going
   to fly in <em>real</em> use?".

 A <b><a href="#misfeature">misfeature</a></b> of a system, especially a

   <code>a</code> is non-zero.  What the programmer probably meant was
   <code>if (a==b) {code;}</code>, which executes <code>code</code> if <code>a</code>

<p><b>green card</b> n. <p>
 [after the "IBM System/360 Reference
   Data" card] A summary of an assembly language, even if the color is
   not green and not a card.  Less frequently used now because of the
   decrease in the use of assembly language.  "I'll go get my green
   card so I can check the addressing mode for that instruction."

<p>The original green card became a yellow card when the System/370
   was introduced, and later a yellow booklet.  An anecdote from IBM
   refers to a scene that took place in a programmers' terminal room
   at Yorktown in 1978.  A <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b> overheard one of the programmers
   ask another "Do you have a green card?"  The other grunted and
   passed the first a thick yellow booklet.  At this point the luser
   turned a delicate shade of olive and rapidly left the room, never
   to return.

<p>In fall 2000 it was reported from Electronic Data Systems that the
   green card for 370 machines has been a blue-green booklet since 1989.

<p><b>grind crank</b> n. // <p>
 A mythical accessory to a terminal.  A
   crank on the side of a monitor, which when operated makes a zizzing
   noise and causes the computer to run faster.  Usually one does not
   refer to a grind crank out loud, but merely makes the appropriate
   gesture and noise.  See <b><a href="#grind">grind</a></b>.

<p>Historical note: At least one real machine actually had a grind
   crank -- the R1, a research machine built toward the end of the
   days of the great vacuum tube computers, in 1959.  R1 (also known
   as `The Rice Institute Computer' (TRIC) and later as `The Rice
   University Computer' (TRUC)) had a single-step/free-run switch for
   use when debugging programs.  Since single-stepping through a large
   program was rather tedious, there was also a crank with a cam and
   gear arrangement that repeatedly pushed the single-step button. 
   This allowed one to `crank' through a lot of code, then slow
   down to single-step for a bit when you got near the code of
   interest, poke at some registers using the console typewriter, and
   then keep on cranking.

<p><b>gritch</b> /grich/ <p>
 [MIT] 1. n. A complaint (often caused by a
   <b><a href="#glitch">glitch</a></b>).  2. vi. To complain.  Often verb-doubled: "Gritch
   gritch".  3. A synonym for <b><a href="#glitch">glitch</a></b> (as verb or noun).

<p>Interestingly, this word seems to have a separate history from
   <b><a href="#glitch">glitch</a></b>, with which it is often confused.  Back in the early
   1960s, when `glitch' was strictly a hardware-tech's term of art,
   the Burton House dorm at M.I.T. maintained a "Gritch Book", a
   blank volume, into which the residents hand-wrote complaints,
   suggestions, and witticisms.  Previous years' volumes of this
   tradition were maintained, dating back to antiquity.  The word
   "gritch" was described as a portmanteau of "gripe" and
   "bitch".  Thus, sense 3 above is at least historically incorrect.

<p><b>grok</b> /grok/, var. /grok/ vt. <p>
 [common; from the
   novel "Stranger in a Strange Land", by Robert A. Heinlein,
   where it is a Martian word meaning literally `to drink' and
   metaphorically `to be one with'] The emphatic form is `grok in
   fullness'. 1. To understand. Connotes intimate and exhaustive
   knowledge.  When you claim to `grok' some knowledge or technique,
   you are asserting that you have not merely learned it in a detached
   instrumental way but that it has become part of you, part of your
   identity.  For example, to say that you "know" <b><a href="#LISP">LISP</a></b> is simply to
   assert that you can code in it if necessary - but to say you
   "grok" LISP is to claim that you have deeply entered the
   world-view and spirit of the language, with the implication that it
   has transformed your view of programming.  Contrast <b><a href="#zen">zen</a></b>, which
   is similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief
   flash.  See also <b><a href="#glark">glark</a></b>.  2. Used of programs, may connote
   merely sufficient understanding.  "Almost all C compilers grok the
   <code>void</code> type these days."

<p><b>grue</b> n. <p>
 [from archaic English verb for `shudder', as
   with fear] The grue was originated in the game <b><a href="#Zork">Zork</a></b> (Dave
   Lebling took the name from Jack Vance's "Dying Earth"
   fantasies) and used in several other <b><a href="#Infocom">Infocom</a></b> games as a hint
   that you should perhaps look for a lamp, torch or some type of
   light source.  Wandering into a dark area would cause the game to
   prompt you, "It is very dark.  If you continue you are likely to
   be eaten by a grue."  If you failed to locate a light source
   within the next couple of moves this would indeed be the
   case.

<p>The grue, according to scholars of the Great Underground Empire, is
   a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth.  Its
   favorite diet is either adventurers or enchanters, but its
   insatiable appetite is tempered by its extreme fear of light. No
   grues have ever been seen by the light of day, and only a few have
   been observed in their underground lairs. Of those who have seen
   grues, few have survived their fearsome jaws to tell the
   tale. Grues have sharp claws and fangs, and an uncontrollable
   tendency to slaver and gurgle. They are certainly the most
   evil-tempered of all creatures; to say they are touchy is a
   dangerous understatement. "Sour as a grue" is a common
   expression, even among grues themselves.

<p>All this folklore is widely known among hackers.

<p><b>guru meditation</b> n. <p>
 Amiga equivalent of `panic' in Unix
   (sometimes just called a `guru' or `guru event').  When the
   system crashes, a cryptic message of the form "GURU MEDITATION
   #XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY" may appear, indicating what the problem was. 
   An Amiga guru can figure things out from the numbers.  Sometimes a
   <b><a href="#guru">guru</a></b> event must be followed by a <b><a href="#Vulcan%20nerve%20pinch">Vulcan nerve pinch</a></b>.

<p>This term is (no surprise) an in-joke from the earliest days of the
   Amiga.  An earlier product of the Amiga corporation was a device
   called a `Joyboard' which was basically a plastic board built onto
   a joystick-like device; it was sold with a skiing game cartridge
   for the Atari game machine.  It is said that whenever the prototype
   OS crashed, the system programmer responsible would calm down by
   concentrating on a solution while sitting cross-legged on a
   Joyboard trying to keep the board in balance.  This position
   resembled that of a meditating guru.  Sadly, the joke was removed
   fairly early on (but there's a well-known patch to restore it in
   more recent versions).

<p><b>gweep</b> /gweep/ <p>
 [WPI] 1. v. To <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b>, usually at
   night.  At WPI, from 1975 onwards, one who gweeped could often be
   found at the College Computing Center punching cards or crashing
   the <b><a href="#PDP-10">PDP-10</a></b> or, later, the DEC-20.  A correspondent who was
   there at the time opines that the term was originally
   onomatopoetic, describing the keyclick sound of the Datapoint
   terminals long connected to the PDP-10; others allege that `gweep'
   was the sound of the Datapoint's bell (compare <b><a href="#feep">feep</a></b>).  The
   term has survived the demise of those technologies, however, and
   was still alive in early 1999.  "I'm going to go gweep for a
   while.  See you in the morning." "I gweep from 8 PM till 3 AM
   during the week."  2. n. One who habitually gweeps in sense 1;
   a <b><a href="#hacker">hacker</a></b>.  "He's a hard-core gweep, mumbles code in his

<p><b>h</b> <p>
 [from SF fandom] A method of `marking' common words,
   i.e., calling attention to the fact that they are being used in a
   nonstandard, ironic, or humorous way.  Originated in the fannish
   catchphrase "Bheer is the One True Ghod!" from decades ago. 
   H-infix marking of `Ghod' and other words spread into the 1960s
   counterculture via underground comix, and into early hackerdom
   either from the counterculture or from SF fandom (the three
   overlapped heavily at the time).  More recently, the h infix has
   become an expected feature of benchmark names (Dhrystone,
   Rhealstone, etc.); this is probably patterning on the original
   Whetstone (the name of a laboratory) but influenced by the
   fannish/counterculture h infix.

<p><b>ha ha only serious</b> <p>
 [from SF fandom, orig. as mutation of
   HHOK, `Ha Ha Only Kidding'] A phrase (often seen abbreviated as
   HHOS) that aptly captures the flavor of much hacker discourse. 
   Applied especially to parodies, absurdities, and ironic jokes that
   are both intended and perceived to contain a possibly disquieting
   amount of truth, or truths that are constructed on in-joke and
   self-parody.  This lexicon contains many examples of
   ha-ha-only-serious in both form and content.  Indeed, the entirety
   of hacker culture is often perceived as ha-ha-only-serious by
   hackers themselves; to take it either too lightly or too seriously
   marks a person as an outsider, a <b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b>, or in <b><a href="#larval%20stage">larval stage</a></b>.  For further enlightenment on this subject, consult any Zen

   physically.  "I can't hack this heat!"  4. vt. To work on
   something (typically a program).  In an immediate sense: "What are
   you doing?"  "I'm hacking TECO."  In a general (time-extended)
   sense: "What do you do around here?"  "I hack TECO."  More
   generally, "I hack `foo'" is roughly equivalent to "`foo' is
   my major interest (or project)".  "I hack solid-state physics." 
   See <b><a href="#Hacking%20X%20for%20Y">Hacking X for Y</a></b>.  5. vt. To pull a prank on.  See
   sense 2 and <b><a href="#hacker">hacker</a></b> (sense 5).  6. vi. To interact with a
   computer in a playful and exploratory rather than goal-directed
   way.  "Whatcha up to?"  "Oh, just hacking."  7. n. Short
   for <b><a href="#hacker">hacker</a></b>.  8. See <b><a href="#nethack">nethack</a></b>.  9. [MIT] v. To explore
   the basements, roof ledges, and steam tunnels of a large,
   institutional building, to the dismay of Physical Plant workers and
   (since this is usually performed at educational institutions) the
   Campus Police.  This activity has been found to be eerily similar
   to playing adventure games such as Dungeons and Dragons and

<p>Constructions on this term abound.  They include `happy hacking'
   (a farewell), `how's hacking?' (a friendly greeting among
   hackers) and `hack, hack' (a fairly content-free but friendly
   comment, often used as a temporary farewell).  For more on this

<p><b>hack mode</b> n. <p>
 1. What one is in when hacking, of course. 
   2. More specifically, a Zen-like state of total focus on The
   Problem that may be achieved when one is hacking (this is why every
   good hacker is part mystic).  Ability to enter such concentration
   at will correlates strongly with wizardliness; it is one of the
   most important skills learned during <b><a href="#larval%20stage">larval stage</a></b>.  Sometimes
   amplified as `deep hack mode'.

<p>Being yanked out of hack mode (see <b><a href="#priority%20interrupt">priority interrupt</a></b>) may be
   experienced as a physical shock, and the sensation of being in hack
   mode is more than a little habituating.  The intensity of this
   experience is probably by itself sufficient explanation for the
   existence of hackers, and explains why many resist being promoted
   out of positions where they can code.  See also <b><a href="#cyberspace">cyberspace</a></b>
   (sense 2).

<p>Some aspects of hacker etiquette will appear quite odd to an
   observer unaware of the high value placed on hack mode.  For
   example, if someone appears at your door, it is perfectly okay to
   hold up a hand (without turning one's eyes away from the screen) to
   avoid being interrupted.  One may read, type, and interact with the
   computer for quite some time before further acknowledging the
   other's presence (of course, he or she is reciprocally free to
   leave without a word).  The understanding is that you might be in
   <b><a href="#hack%20mode">hack mode</a></b> with a lot of delicate <b><a href="#state">state</a></b> (sense 2) in your

 Often adduced as the reason or motivation for

   installed purely for hack value.  See <b><a href="#display%20hack">display hack</a></b> for one
   method of computing hack value, but this cannot really be
   explained, only experienced.  As Louis Armstrong once said when
   asked to explain jazz: "Man, if you gotta ask you'll never know." 
   (Feminists please note Fats Waller's explanation of rhythm: "Lady,

<p><b>hacked off</b> adj. <p>
 [analogous to `pissed off'] Said of
   system administrators who have become annoyed, upset, or touchy
   owing to suspicions that their sites have been or are going to be
   victimized by crackers, or used for inappropriate, technically
   illegal, or even overtly criminal activities.  For example, having
   unreadable files in your home directory called `worm',
   `lockpick', or `goroot' would probably be an effective (as well
   as impressively obvious and stupid) way to get your sysadmin hacked
   off at you.

<p>It has been pointed out that there is precedent for this usage in
   U.S. Navy slang, in which officers under discipline are sometimes
   said to be "in hack" and one may speak of "hacking off the C.O.".

<p><b>hacker</b> n. <p>
 [originally, someone who makes furniture with an
   axe] 1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable
   systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
   users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who
   programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
   programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A
   person capable of appreciating <b><a href="#hack%20value">hack value</a></b>.  4. A person who is
   good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,
   or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in `a Unix
   hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who
   fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One
   might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the
   intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
   limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to
   discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence `password
   hacker', `network hacker'.  The correct term for this sense is
   <b><a href="#cracker">cracker</a></b>.

<p>The term `hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global
   community defined by the net (see <b><a href="#the%20network">the network</a></b> and
   <b><a href="#Internet%20address">Internet address</a></b>).  For discussion of some of the basics of
   this culture, see the
   <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How To Become A Hacker</a> FAQ. It also implies that the person described
   is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic (see
   <b><a href="#hacker%20ethic">hacker ethic</a></b>).

<p>It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
   oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an
   elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new
   members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego
   satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if
   you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled
   <b><a href="#bogus">bogus</a></b>).  See also <b><a href="#geek">geek</a></b>, <b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b>.

<p>This term seems to have been first adopted as a badge in the 1960s
   by the hacker culture surrounding TMRC and the MIT AI Lab.  We have
   a report that it was used in a sense close to this entry's by teenage
   radio hams and electronics tinkerers in the mid-1950s.

<p><b>hacker ethic</b> n. <p>
 1. The belief that information-sharing
   is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of
   hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source code and
   facilitating access to information and to computing resources
   wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and
   exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no
   theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.

<p>Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no
   means universally, accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe
   to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and
   giving away open-source software.  A few go further and assert that
   <em>all</em> information should be free and <em>any</em> proprietary
   control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the <b><a href="#GNU">GNU</a></b>
   project.

<p>Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of
   cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.  But
   the belief that `ethical' cracking excludes destruction at least
   moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as `benign'
   crackers (see also <b><a href="#samurai">samurai</a></b>, <b><a href="#gray%20hat">gray hat</a></b>).  On this view, it
   may be one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to (a) break
   into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably by
   email from a <b><a href="#superuser">superuser</a></b> account, exactly how it was done and
   how the hole can be plugged -- acting as an unpaid (and
   unsolicited) <b><a href="#tiger%20team">tiger team</a></b>.

<p>The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker
   ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share
   technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing
   resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as
   <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b>, <b><a href="#FidoNet">FidoNet</a></b> and the Internet itself can function
   without central control because of this trait; they both rely on
   and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom's most
   valuable intangible asset.

<p><b>hacker humor</b> <p>
 A distinctive style of shared
   intellectual humor found among hackers, having the following marked
   characteristics:

<p>1. Fascination with form-vs.-content jokes, paradoxes, and humor
   having to do with confusion of metalevels (see <b><a href="#meta">meta</a></b>).  One way
   to make a hacker laugh: hold a red index card in front of him/her
   with "GREEN" written on it, or vice-versa (note, however, that
   this is funny only the first time).

<p>2. Elaborate deadpan parodies of large intellectual constructs,
   such as specifications (see <b><a href="#write-only%20memory">write-only memory</a></b>), standards
   documents, language descriptions (see <b><a href="#INTERCAL">INTERCAL</a></b>), and even
   entire scientific theories (see <b><a href="#quantum%20bogodynamics">quantum bogodynamics</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#computron">computron</a></b>).

<p>3. Jokes that involve screwily precise reasoning from bizarre,
   ludicrous, or just grossly counter-intuitive premises.

<p>4. Fascination with puns and wordplay.

<p>5. A fondness for apparently mindless humor with subversive
   currents of intelligence in it -- for example, old Warner Brothers
   and Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle cartoons, the Marx brothers, the early
   B-52s, and Monty Python's Flying Circus.  Humor that combines this
   trait with elements of high camp and slapstick is especially
   favored.

<p>6. References to the symbol-object antinomies and associated ideas
   in Zen Buddhism and (less often) Taoism.  See <b><a href="#has%20the%20X%20nature">has the X nature</a></b>, <b><a href="#Discordianism">Discordianism</a></b>, <b><a href="#zen">zen</a></b>, <b><a href="#ha%20ha%20only%20serious">ha ha only serious</a></b>,

   that all six of these traits are really aspects of one thing that
   is incredibly difficult to talk about exactly, you are (a) correct
   and (b) responding like a hacker.  These traits are also
   recognizable (though in a less marked form) throughout

<p><b>hairy</b> adj. <p>
 1. Annoyingly complicated.  "<b><a href="#DWIM">DWIM</a></b> is
   incredibly hairy."  2. Incomprehensible.  "<b><a href="#DWIM">DWIM</a></b> is
   incredibly hairy."  3. Of people, high-powered, authoritative,
   rare, expert, and/or incomprehensible.  Hard to explain except in
   context: "He knows this hairy lawyer who says there's nothing to
   worry about."  See also <b><a href="#hirsute">hirsute</a></b>.

<p>There is a theorem in simplicial homology theory which states that
   any continuous tangent field on a 2-sphere is null at least in a
   point.  Mathematically literate hackers tend to associate the term
   `hairy' with the informal version of this theorem; "You can't comb
   a hairy ball smooth."  (Previous versions of this entry
   associating the above informal statement with the Brouwer
   fixed-point theorem were incorrect.)

<p>The adjective `long-haired' is well-attested to have been in
   slang use among scientists and engineers during the early 1950s; it
   was equivalent to modern `hairy' senses 1 and 2, and was very
   likely ancestral to the hackish use.  In fact the noun
   `long-hair' was at the time used to describe a person satisfying
   sense 3.  Both senses probably passed out of use when long hair
   was adopted as a signature trait by the 1960s counterculture,
   leaving hackish `hairy' as a sort of stunted mutant relic.

<p>In British mainstream use, "hairy" means "dangerous", and
   consequently, in British programming terms, "hairy" may be used
   to denote complicated and/or incomprehensible code, but only if
   that complexity or incomprehesiveness is also considered dangerous.

<p><b>HAKMEM</b> /hak'mem/ n. <p>
 MIT AI Memo 239 (February 1972).  A
   legendary collection of neat mathematical and programming hacks
   contributed by many people at MIT and elsewhere.  (The title of the
   memo really is "HAKMEM", which is a 6-letterism for `hacks
   memo'.)  Some of them are very useful techniques, powerful
   theorems, or interesting unsolved problems, but most fall into the
   category of mathematical and computer trivia.  Here is a sampling
   of the entries (with authors), slightly paraphrased:

<p>Item 41 (Gene Salamin): There are exactly 23,000 prime numbers less
   than 2^(18).

<p>Item 46 (Rich Schroeppel): The most <em>probable</em> suit
   distribution in bridge hands is 4-4-3-2, as compared to 4-3-3-3,
   which is the most <em>evenly</em> distributed.  This is because the
   world likes to have unequal numbers: a thermodynamic effect saying
   things will not be in the state of lowest energy, but in the state
   of lowest disordered energy.

<p>Item 81 (Rich Schroeppel): Count the magic squares of order 5
   (that is, all the 5-by-5 arrangements of the numbers from 1 to 25
   such that all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same
   number).  There are about 320 million, not counting those that
   differ only by rotation and reflection.

<p>Item 154 (Bill Gosper): The myth that any given programming
   language is machine independent is easily exploded by computing the
   sum of powers of 2.  If the result loops with period = 1
   with sign +, you are on a sign-magnitude machine.  If the
   result loops with period = 1 at -1, you are on a
   twos-complement machine.  If the result loops with period greater
   than 1, including the beginning, you are on a ones-complement
   machine.  If the result loops with period greater than 1, not
   including the beginning, your machine isn't binary -- the pattern
   should tell you the base.  If you run out of memory, you are on a
   string or bignum system.  If arithmetic overflow is a fatal error,
   some fascist pig with a read-only mind is trying to enforce machine
   independence.  But the very ability to trap overflow is machine
   dependent.  By this strategy, consider the universe, or, more
   precisely, algebra: Let X = the sum of many powers of 2 =
   <small>...</small>111111 (base 2).  Now add X to itself:
   X + X = <small>...</small>111110.  Thus, 2X = X - 1, so
   X = -1.  Therefore algebra is run on a machine (the
   universe) that is two's-complement.

<p>Item 174 (Bill Gosper and Stuart Nelson): 21963283741 is the only
   number such that if you represent it on the <b><a href="#PDP-10">PDP-10</a></b> as both an
   integer and a floating-point number, the bit patterns of the two
   representations are identical.

<p>Item 176 (Gosper): The "banana phenomenon" was encountered when
   processing a character string by taking the last 3 letters typed
   out, searching for a random occurrence of that sequence in the
   text, taking the letter following that occurrence, typing it out,
   and iterating.  This ensures that every 4-letter string output
   occurs in the original.  The program typed BANANANANANANANA<small>...</small>.  We
   note an ambiguity in the phrase, "the Nth occurrence of."  In one
   sense, there are five 00's in 0000000000; in another, there are
   nine.  The editing program TECO finds five.  Thus it finds only the
   first ANA in BANANA, and is thus obligated to type N next.  By
   Murphy's Law, there is but one NAN, thus forcing A, and thus a
   loop.  An option to find overlapped instances would be useful,
   although it would require backing up N - 1 characters before
   seeking the next N-character string.

   implementation.  See also <b><a href="#banana%20problem">banana problem</a></b>.

<p><b>hakspek</b> /hak'speek/ n. <p>
 A shorthand method of spelling
   found on many British academic bulletin boards and <b><a href="#talker%20system">talker system</a></b>s.  Syllables and whole words in a sentence are replaced by
   single ASCII characters the names of which are phonetically similar
   or equivalent, while multiple letters are usually dropped.  Hence,
   `for' becomes `4'; `two', `too', and `to' become `2';
   `ck' becomes `k'.  "Before I see you tomorrow" becomes "b4 i
   c u 2moro".  First appeared in London about 1986, and was probably
   caused by the slowness of available talker systems, which operated
   on archaic machines with outdated operating systems and no standard
   methods of communication.

<p>Hakspek almost diappeared after the great bandwidth explosion of
   the early 1990s, as fast Internet links wiped out the old-style
   talker systems.  However, it has enjoyed a revival in another
   medium - the Short Message Service (SMS) associated with GSM
   cellphones.  SMS sends are limited to a maximum of 160 characters,
   and typing on a cellphone keypad is difficult and slow anyway. 
   There are now even published paper dictionaries for SMS users
   to help them do hakspek-to-English and vice-versa.

<p><b>handwave</b> <p>
 [poss. from gestures characteristic of stage
   magicians] 1. v. To gloss over a complex point; to distract a
   listener; to support a (possibly actually valid) point with
   blatantly faulty logic.  2. n. The act of handwaving.  "Boy, what
   a handwave!"

<p>If someone starts a sentence with "Clearly<small>...</small>" or
   "Obviously<small>...</small>" or "It is self-evident that<small>...</small>", it is
   a good bet he is about to handwave (alternatively, use of these
   constructions in a sarcastic tone before a paraphrase of someone
   else's argument suggests that it is a handwave).  The theory behind
   this term is that if you wave your hands at the right moment, the
   listener may be sufficiently distracted to not notice that what you
   have said is <b><a href="#bogus">bogus</a></b>.  Failing that, if a listener does object,
   you might try to dismiss the objection with a wave of your hand.

<p>The use of this word is often accompanied by gestures: both hands
   up, palms forward, swinging the hands in a vertical plane pivoting
   at the elbows and/or shoulders (depending on the magnitude of the
   handwave); alternatively, holding the forearms in one position
   while rotating the hands at the wrist to make them flutter.  In
   context, the gestures alone can suffice as a remark; if a speaker
   makes an outrageously unsupported assumption, you might simply wave
   your hands in this way, as an accusation, far more eloquent than
   words could express, that his logic is faulty.

<p><b>Hanlon's Razor</b> prov. <p>
 A corollary of <b><a href="#Finagle's%20Law">Finagle's Law</a></b>,
   similar to Occam's Razor, that reads "Never attribute to malice
   that which can be adequately explained by stupidity."  The
   derivation of the Hanlon eponym is not definitely known, but a very
   similar remark ("You have attributed conditions to villainy that
   simply result from stupidity.") appears in "Logic of Empire",
   a classic 1941 SF story by Robert A. Heinlein, who calls it the
   `devil theory' of sociology.  Heinlein's popularity in the hacker
   culture makes plausible the supposition that `Hanlon' is derived
   from `Heinlein' by phonetic corruption.  A similar epigram has been
   attributed to William James, but Heinlein more probably got the
   idea from Alfred Korzybski and other practitioners of General
   Semantics.  Quoted here because it seems to be a particular
   favorite of hackers, often showing up in <b><a href="#sig%20block">sig block</a></b>s,
   <b><a href="#fortune%20cookie">fortune cookie</a></b> files and the login banners of BBS systems and

<p><b>happily</b> adv. <p>
 Of software, used to emphasize that a
   program is unaware of some important fact about its environment,
   either because it has been fooled into believing a lie, or because
   it doesn't care.  The sense of `happy' here is not that of
   elation, but rather that of blissful ignorance.  "The program
   continues to run, happily unaware that its output is going to
   /dev/null."  Also used to suggest that a program or device would
   really rather be doing something destructive, and is being given an
   opportunity to do so.  "If you enter an O here instead of a zero,
   the program will happily erase all your data." Neverheless, use of
   this term implies a basically benign attitude towards the program:
   It didn't mean any harm, it was just eager to do its job. We'd like
   to be angry at it but we shouldn't, we should try to understand it
   instead. The adjective "cheerfully" is often used in exactly the
   same way.

<p><b>hash bucket</b> n. <p>
 A notional receptacle, a set of which might
   be used to apportion data items for sorting or lookup purposes. 
   When you look up a name in the phone book (for example), you
   typically hash it by extracting its first letter; the hash buckets
   are the alphabetically ordered letter sections.  This term is used
   as techspeak with respect to code that uses actual hash functions;
   in jargon, it is used for human associative memory as well.  Thus,
   two things `in the same hash bucket' are more difficult to
   discriminate, and may be confused.  "If you hash English words
   only by length, you get too many common grammar words in the first

<p><b>heartbeat</b> n. <p>
 1. The signal emitted by a Level 2 Ethernet
   transceiver at the end of every packet to show that the
   collision-detection circuit is still connected.  2. A periodic
   synchronization signal used by software or hardware, such as a bus
   clock or a periodic interrupt.  3. The `natural' oscillation
   frequency of a computer's clock crystal, before frequency division
   down to the machine's clock rate.  4. A signal emitted at regular
   intervals by software to demonstrate that it is still alive. 
   Sometimes hardware is designed to reboot the machine if it stops
   hearing a heartbeat.  See also <b><a href="#breath-of-life%20packet">breath-of-life packet</a></b>.

<p><b>heatseeker</b> n. <p>
 [IBM] A customer who can be relied upon to
   buy, without fail, the latest version of an existing product (not
   quite the same as a member of the <b><a href="#lunatic%20fringe">lunatic fringe</a></b>).  A 1993
   example of a heatseeker was someone who, owning a 286 PC and
   Windows 3.0, went out and bought Windows 3.1 (which offers no
   worthwhile benefits unless you have a 386).  If all customers were
   heatseekers, vast amounts of money could be made by just fixing
   some of the bugs in each release (n) and selling it to them as
   release (n+1).  Microsoft in fact seems to have mastered this
   technique.

<p><b>hexadecimal</b> n. <p>
 Base 16.  Coined in the early 1950s to
   replace earlier `sexadecimal', which was too racy and amusing
   for stuffy IBM, and later adopted by the rest of the industry.

<p>Actually, neither term is etymologically pure.  If we take
   `binary' to be paradigmatic, the most etymologically correct
   term for base 10, for example, is `denary', which comes from
   `deni' (ten at a time, ten each), a Latin `distributive'
   number; the corresponding term for base-16 would be something like
   `sendenary'.  "Decimal" comes from the combining root of
   `decem', Latin for 10. If wish to create a truly analogous word
   for base 16, we should start with `sedecim', Latin for 16. Ergo,
   `sedecimal' is the word that would have been created by a Latin
   scholar.  The `sexa-' prefix is Latin but incorrect in this
   context, and `hexa-' is Greek.  The word `octal' is
   similarly incorrect; a correct form would be `octaval' (to go
   with decimal), or `octonary' (to go with binary).  If anyone ever
   implements a base-3 computer, computer scientists will be faced
   with the unprecedented dilemma of a choice between two
   <em>correct</em> forms; both `ternary' and `trinary' have a
   claim to this throne.

   add a test for some otherwise meaningless feature of the existing

   a program very hard to debug and understand, but is all too common

<p><b>hog</b> n.,vt. <p>
 1. Favored term to describe programs or
   hardware that seem to eat far more than their share of a system's
   resources, esp. those which noticeably degrade interactive
   response.  <em>Not</em> used of programs that are simply extremely
   large or complex or that are merely painfully slow themselves. 
   More often than not encountered in qualified forms, e.g., `memory
   hog', `core hog', `hog the processor', `hog the disk'.  "A
   controller that never gives up the I/O bus gets killed after the
   bus-hog timer expires."  2. Also said of <em>people</em> who use
   more than their fair share of resources (particularly disk, where
   it seems that 10% of the people use 90% of the disk, no matter how
   big the disk is or how many people use it).  Of course, once disk
   hogs fill up one filesystem, they typically find some other new one
   to infect, claiming to the sysadmin that they have an important new
   project to complete.

 A region in an otherwise <b><a href="#flat">flat</a></b> entity which is

   large files with holes so that unused regions of the file are never
   actually stored on disk.  (In techspeak, these are referred to as
   `sparse' files.)  As another example, the region of memory in IBM
   PCs reserved for memory-mapped I/O devices which may not actually
   be present is called `the I/O hole', since memory-management
   systems must skip over this area when filling user requests for
   memory.

<p><b>hollised</b> /hol'ist/ adj. <p>
 [Usenet: <i>sci.space</i>]
   To be hollised is to have been ordered by one's employer not to
   post any even remotely job-related material to Usenet (or, by
   extension, to other Internet media).  The original and most
   notorious case of this involved one Ken Hollis, a Lockheed
   employee and space-program enthusiast who posted publicly available
   material on access to Space Shuttle launches to <i>sci.space</i>. 
   He was gagged under threat of being fired in 1994 at the behest of
   NASA public-relations officers. The result was, of course, a huge
   publicity black eye for NASA.  Nevertheless several other NASA
   contractor employees were subsequently hollised for similar
   activities.  Use of this term carries the strong connotation that
   the persons doing the gagging are bureaucratic idiots blinded to
   their own best interests by territorial reflexes.

   common] n. <b><a href="#flame%20war">flame war</a></b>s over <b><a href="#religious%20issues">religious issues</a></b>.  The
   paper by Danny Cohen that popularized the terms <b><a href="#big-endian">big-endian</a></b> and
   <b><a href="#little-endian">little-endian</a></b> in connection with the LSB-first/MSB-first
   controversy was entitled "On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace".

   vs. <b><a href="#vi">vi</a></b>, my personal computer vs. everyone else's personal

   wars from normal technical disputes is that in a holy war most of
   the participants spend their time trying to pass off personal value
   choices and cultural attachments as objective technical
   evaluations.  This happens precisely because in a true holy war,
   the actual substantive differences between the sides are
   relatively minor.  See also <b><a href="#theology">theology</a></b>.

 1. One's personal billboard on the World Wide
   Web.  The term `home page' is perhaps a bit misleading because home
   directories and physical homes in <b><a href="#RL">RL</a></b> are private, but home
   pages are designed to be very public.  2. By extension, a WWW

<p><b>honey pot</b> n. <p>
 A box designed to attract <b><a href="#cracker">cracker</a></b>s so
   that they can be observed in action. It is usually well isolated
   from the rest of the network, but has extensive logging (usually
   network layer, on a different machine).  Different from an <b><a href="#iron%20box">iron box</a></b> in that it's purpose is to attract, not merely observe. 
   Sometimes, it is also a defensive network security tactic - you
   set up an easy-to-crack box so that your real servers don't get
   messed with.  The concept was presented in Cheswick &amp; Bellovin's
   book "Firewalls and Internet Security".

<p><b>hook</b> n. <p>
 A software or hardware feature included in order to
   simplify later additions or changes by a user.  For example, a
   simple program that prints numbers might always print them in base
   10, but a more flexible version would let a variable determine what
   base to use; setting the variable to 5 would make the program print
   numbers in base 5.  The variable is a simple hook.  An even more
   flexible program might examine the variable and treat a value of 16
   or less as the base to use, but treat any other number as the
   address of a user-supplied routine for printing a number.  This is
   a <b><a href="#hairy">hairy</a></b> but powerful hook; one can then write a routine to
   print numbers as Roman numerals, say, or as Hebrew characters, and
   plug it into the program through the hook.  Often the difference
   between a good program and a superb one is that the latter has
   useful hooks in judiciously chosen places.  Both may do the
   original job about equally well, but the one with the hooks is much
   more flexible for future expansion of capabilities (<b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b>, for
   example, is <em>all</em> hooks).  The term `user exit' is
   synonymous but much more formal and less hackish.

<p><b>hop</b> <p>
 1. n. [common] One file transmission in a series
   required to get a file from point A to point B on a
   store-and-forward network.  On such networks (including
   <b><a href="#UUCPNET">UUCPNET</a></b> and <b><a href="#FidoNet">FidoNet</a></b>), an important inter-machine metric
   is the number of hops in the shortest path between them, which can
   be more significant than their geographical separation.  See
   <b><a href="#bang%20path">bang path</a></b>. 2. v. [rare] To log in to a remote machine,
   esp. via rlogin or telnet. "I'll hop over to foovax to FTP that."

   through which data flows under pressure.  Generally denotes data
   paths that represent performance bottlenecks.  3. n. Cabling,
   especially thick Ethernet cable.  This is sometimes called `bit
   hose' or `hosery' (play on `hosiery') or `etherhose'.  See

<p><b>hosed</b> adj. <p>
 Same as <b><a href="#down">down</a></b>.  Used primarily by Unix
   hackers.  Humorous: also implies a condition thought to be
   relatively easy to reverse.  Probably derived from the Canadian
   slang `hoser' popularized by the Bob and Doug Mackenzie skits on
   SCTV, but this usage predated SCTV by years in hackerdom (it was
   certainly already live at CMU in the 1970s).  See <b><a href="#hose">hose</a></b>.  It is
   also widely used of people in the mainstream sense of `in an
   extremely unfortunate situation'.

<p>Once upon a time, a Cray that had been experiencing periodic
   difficulties crashed, and it was announced to have been hosed. 
   It was discovered that the crash was due to the disconnection of
   some coolant hoses.  The problem was corrected, and users were then
   assured that everything was OK because the system had been rehosed.

<p><b>hot spot</b> n. <p>
 1. [primarily used by C/Unix programmers, but
   spreading] It is received wisdom that in most programs, less than
   10% of the code eats 90% of the execution time; if one were to
   graph instruction visits versus code addresses, one would typically
   see a few huge spikes amidst a lot of low-level noise.  Such spikes
   are called `hot spots' and are good candidates for heavy
   optimization or <b><a href="#hand-hacking">hand-hacking</a></b>.  The term is especially used of
   tight loops and recursions in the code's central algorithm, as
   opposed to (say) initial set-up costs or large but infrequent I/O
   operations.  See <b><a href="#tune">tune</a></b>, <b><a href="#bum">bum</a></b>, <b><a href="#hand-hacking">hand-hacking</a></b>.  2. The
   active location of a cursor on a bit-map display.  "Put the
   mouse's hot spot on the `ON' widget and click the left button." 
   3. A screen region that is sensitive to mouse gestures, which
   trigger some action.  World Wide Web pages now provide the
   <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b> examples; WWW browsers present hypertext links as
   hot spots which, when clicked on, point the browser at another
   document (these are specifically called <b><a href="#hotlink">hotlink</a></b>s).  4. In a
   massively parallel computer with shared memory, the one location
   that all 10,000 processors are trying to read or write at once
   (perhaps because they are all doing a <b><a href="#busy-wait">busy-wait</a></b> on the same
   lock).  5. More generally, any place in a hardware design that
   turns into a performance bottleneck due to resource
   contention.

 A <b><a href="#hot%20spot">hot spot</a></b> on a World Wide Web
   page; an area, which, when clicked or selected, chases a URL. 
   Also spelled `hot link'.  Use of this term focuses on the link's

   timeless sense of logical connection suggested by <b><a href="#web%20pointer">web pointer</a></b>. Your screen shows hotlinks but your document has web

<p><b>house wizard</b> n. <p>
 [prob. from ad-agency tradetalk, `house
   freak'] A hacker occupying a technical-specialist, R&amp;D, or systems
   position at a commercial shop.  A really effective house wizard can
   have influence out of all proportion to his/her ostensible rank and
   still not have to wear a suit.  Used esp. of Unix wizards.  The
   term `house guru' is equivalent.

<p><b>HP-SUX</b> /H-P suhks/ n. <p>
 Unflattering hackerism for
   HP-UX, Hewlett-Packard's Unix port, which features some truly
   unique bogosities in the filesystem internals and elsewhere (these
   occasionally create portability problems).  HP-UX is often referred
   to as `hockey-pux' inside HP, and one respondent claims that the
   proper pronunciation is /H-P ukkkhhhh/ as though one were about
   to spit.  Another such alternate spelling and pronunciation is
   "H-PUX" /H-puhks/.  Hackers at HP/Apollo (the former Apollo
   Computers which was swallowed by HP in 1989) have been heard to
   complain that Mr. Packard should have pushed to have his name
   first, if for no other reason than the greater eloquence of the

   <b><a href="#hosed">hosed</a></b>.  See also <b><a href="#hang">hang</a></b>.  A hung state is distinguished
   from <b><a href="#crash">crash</a></b>ed or <b><a href="#down">down</a></b>, where the program or system is also
   unusable but because it is not running rather than because it is

 A memory location that is

   looks like the program jumped off to hyperspace somehow." 
   (Compare <b><a href="#jump%20off%20into%20never-never%20land">jump off into never-never land</a></b>.)  This usage is from
   the SF notion of a spaceship jumping `into hyperspace', that is,
   taking a shortcut through higher-dimensional space -- in other
   words, bypassing this universe.  The variant `east hyperspace' is
   recorded among CMU and Bliss hackers.

 Hackers (and the interactive computer

   "X is missing."  or "Where's the X?".  This goes back to the

   you asked it to do something involving an object not present at

<p><b>IBM</b> /I-B-M/ <p>
 Once upon a time, the computer company most
   hackers loved to hate; today, the one they are most puzzled to find
   themselves liking.

<p>From hackerdom's beginnings in the mid-1960s to the early 1990s,
   IBM was regarded with active loathing.  Common expansions of the
   corporate name included: Inferior But Marketable; It's Better
   Manually; Insidious Black Magic; It's Been Malfunctioning;
   Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a near-<b><a href="#infinite">infinite</a></b> number of even
   less complimentary expansions (see also <b><a href="#fear%20and%20loathing">fear and loathing</a></b>). 
   What galled hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level
   wasn't so much that they were underpowered and overpriced (though
   that counted against them), but that the designs were incredibly
   archaic, <b><a href="#crufty">crufty</a></b>, and <b><a href="#elephantine">elephantine</a></b> <small>...</small> and you couldn't
   <em>fix</em> them -- source code was locked up tight, and
   programming tools were expensive, hard to find, and bletcherous to
   use once you had found them.

<p>We didn't know how good we had it back then.  In the 1990s,
   Microsoft became more noxious and omnipresent than IBM had ever
   been. Then, in the 1980s IBM had its own troubles with Microsoft
   and lost its strategic way, receding from the hacker community's
   view.

<p>In the late 1990s IBM re-invented itself as a services company,
   began to release open-source software through its AlphaWorks group,
   and began shipping <b><a href="#Linux">Linux</a></b> systems and building ties to the
   Linux community.  To the astonishment of all parties, IBM emerged
   as a staunch friend of the hacker community and <b><a href="#open%20source">open source</a></b>
   development.

<p>This lexicon includes a number of entries attributed to `IBM';
   these derive from some rampantly unofficial jargon lists circulated
   within IBM's formerly beleaguered hacker underground.

 (Also `missile address') The form

   This was actually used for generating geographically-correct maps of
   Usenet links on a plotter; however, it became traditional to
   refer to this as one's `ICBM address' or `missile address', and
   some people include it in their <b><a href="#sig%20block">sig block</a></b> with that name.  (A

<p><b>ice</b> n. <p>
 [coined by Usenetter Tom Maddox, popularized by
   William Gibson's cyberpunk SF novels: a contrived acronym for
   `Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics'] Security software (in
   Gibson's novels, software that responds to intrusion by attempting
   to immobilize or even literally kill the intruder).  Hence,
   `icebreaker': a program designed for cracking security on a
   system.

<p>Neither term is in serious use yet as of early 2001, but many
   hackers find the metaphor attractive, and each may develop a
   denotation in the future. In the meantime, the speculative usage
   could be confused with `ICE', an acronym for "in-circuit
   emulator".

<p>In ironic reference to the speculative usage, however, some hackers
   and computer scientists formed ICE (International Cryptographic
   Experiment) in 1994. ICE is a consortium to promote uniform
   international access to strong cryptography.

<p><b>idempotent</b> adj. <p>
 [from mathematical techspeak] Acting as if
   used only once, even if used multiple times.  This term is often
   used with respect to <b><a href="#C">C</a></b> header files, which contain common
   definitions and declarations to be included by several source
   files.  If a header file is ever included twice during the same
   compilation (perhaps due to nested #include files), compilation
   errors can result unless the header file has protected itself
   against multiple inclusion; a header file so protected is said to
   be idempotent.  The term can also be used to describe an
   initialization subroutine that is arranged to perform some critical
   action exactly once, even if the routine is called several times.

<p><b>indent style</b> n. <p>
 [C, C++, and Java programmers] The rules
   one uses to indent code in a readable fashion.  There are four
   major C indent styles, described below; all have the aim of making
   it easier for the reader to visually track the scope of control
   constructs.  They have been inherited by C++ and Java, which have
   C-like syntaxes.  The significant variable is the placement of <code>{</code>
   and <code>}</code> with respect to the statement(s) they enclose and to
   the guard or controlling statement (<code>if</code>, <code>else</code>,
   <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, or <code>do</code>) on the block, if any.

<p>`K&amp;R style' -- Named after Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, because the
   examples in <b><a href="#K&amp;R">K&amp;R</a></b> are formatted this way.  Also called `kernel
   style' because the Unix kernel is written in it, and the `One True
   Brace Style' (abbrev. 1TBS) by its partisans.  In C code, the body
   is typically indented by eight spaces (or one tab) per level, as
   shown here. Four spaces are occasionally seen in C, but in C++ and
   Java four tends to be the rule rather than the exception.

<pre>if (&lt;cond&gt;) {
        &lt;body&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>`Allman style' -- Named for Eric Allman, a Berkeley hacker who
   wrote a lot of the BSD utilities in it (it is sometimes called
   `BSD style').  Resembles normal indent style in Pascal and Algol. 
   It is the only style other than K&amp;R in widespread use among Java
   programmers. Basic indent per level shown here is eight spaces, but
   four (or sometimes three) spaces are generally preferred by C++ and
   Java programmers.

<pre>if (&lt;cond&gt;)
{
        &lt;body&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>`Whitesmiths style' -- popularized by the examples that came
   with Whitesmiths C, an early commercial C compiler.  Basic indent
   per level shown here is eight spaces, but four spaces are
   occasionally seen.

<pre>if (&lt;cond&gt;)
        {
        &lt;body&gt;
        }
</pre>

<p>`GNU style' -- Used throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software
   Foundation code, and just about nowhere else.  Indents are always
   four spaces per level, with <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> halfway between the
   outer and inner indent levels.

<pre>if (&lt;cond&gt;)
  {
    &lt;body&gt;
  }
</pre>

<p>Surveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most
   common, with about equal mind shares.  K&amp;R/1TBS used to be nearly
   universal, but is now much less common in C (the opening brace tends to
   get lost against the right paren of the guard part in an <code>if</code>
   or <code>while</code>, which is a <b><a href="#Bad%20Thing">Bad Thing</a></b>).  Defenders of 1TBS
   argue that any putative gain in readability is less important than
   their style's relative economy with vertical space, which enables
   one to see more code on one's screen at once.

<p>The Java Language Specification legislates not only the
   capitalization of identifiers, but where nouns, adjectives, and
   verbs should be in method, class, interface, and variable names
   (section 6.8). While the specification stops short of also
   standardizing on a bracing style, all source code originating from
   Sun Laboratories uses the K&amp;R style.  This has set a precedent for
   Java programmers, which most follow.

<p>Doubtless these issues will continue to be the subject of <b><a href="#holy%20wars">holy wars</a></b>.

<p><b>infant mortality</b> n. <p>
 It is common lore among hackers (and in
   the electronics industry at large; this term is possibly techspeak
   by now) that the chances of sudden hardware failure drop off
   exponentially with a machine's time since first use (that is, until
   the relatively distant time at which enough mechanical wear in I/O
   devices and thermal-cycling stress in components has accumulated
   for the machine to start going senile).  Up to half of all chip and
   wire failures happen within a new system's first few weeks; such
   failures are often referred to as `infant mortality' problems
   (or, occasionally, as `sudden infant death syndrome').  See

   script for Hamlet."  (One may also hypothesize a small number of
   monkeys and a very long period of time.)  This theorem asserts
   nothing about the intelligence of the one <b><a href="#random">random</a></b> monkey that
   eventually comes up with the script (and note that the mob will
   also type out all the possible <em>incorrect</em> versions of
   Hamlet).  It may be referred to semi-seriously when justifying a
   <b><a href="#brute%20force">brute force</a></b> method; the implication is that, with enough
   resources thrown at it, any technical challenge becomes a
   <b><a href="#one-banana%20problem">one-banana problem</a></b>.  This argument gets more respect since
   <b><a href="#Linux">Linux</a></b> justified the <b><a href="#bazaar">bazaar</a></b> mode of development.

<p>This theorem was first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur
   Eddington.  It became part of the idiom of techies via the classic
   SF short story "Inflexible Logic" by Russell Maloney, and
   many younger hackers know it through a reference in Douglas Adams's
   "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".  On 1 April 2000 the usage
   acquired its own Internet standard, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2795.txt">RFC2795</a> (Infinite Monkey
   Protocol Suite).

<p><b>infinity</b> n. <p>
 1. The largest value that can be represented in
   a particular type of variable (register, memory location, data
   type, whatever).  2. `minus infinity': The smallest such value,
   not necessarily or even usually the simple negation of plus
   infinity.  In N-bit twos-complement arithmetic, infinity is
   2^(N-1) - 1 but minus infinity is -
   (2^(N-1)), not -(2^(N-1) - 1).  Note also that this
   is different from <dfn>time T equals minus infinity</dfn>, which is
   closer to a mathematician's usage of infinity.

<p><b>Infocom</b> n. <p>
 A now-legendary games company, active from
   1979 to 1989, that commercialized the MDL parser technology used
   for <b><a href="#Zork">Zork</a></b> to produce a line of text adventure games that remain
   favorites among hackers.  Infocom's games were intelligent, funny,
   witty, erudite, irreverent, challenging, satirical, and most
   thoroughly hackish in spirit.  The physical game packages from
   Infocom are now prized collector's items.  After being acquired by
   Activision in 1989 they did a few more "modern"
   (e.g. graphics-intensive) games which were less successful than
   reissues of their classics.

<p>The software, thankfully, is still extant; Infocom games were
   written in a kind of P-code and distributed with a P-code
   interpreter core, and not only open-source emulators for that
   interpreter but an actual compiler as well have been written to
   permit the P-code to be run on platforms the games never originally
   graced. In fact, new games written in this P-code are still being
   written.  There is a home page at

<p><b>INTERCAL</b> /in't*r-kal/ n. <p>
 [said by the authors to stand
   for `Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym'] A computer
   language designed by Don Woods and James Lyons in 1972.  INTERCAL
   is purposely different from all other computer languages in all
   ways but one; it is purely a written language, being totally
   unspeakable.  An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference Manual will
   make the style of the language clear:

<blockquote>
It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose
work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem.  For example, if
one were to state that the simplest way to store a value of 65536
in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is:

<pre>DO :1 &lt;- #0$#256
</pre>

<p>any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd.  Since this
is indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look
foolish in front of his boss, who would of course have happened to
turn up, as bosses are wont to do.  The effect would be no less
devastating for the programmer having been correct. 
</blockquote>

<p>INTERCAL has many other peculiar features designed to make it even
   more unspeakable.  The Woods-Lyons implementation was actually used
   by many (well, at least several) people at Princeton.  The language
   has been recently reimplemented as C-INTERCAL and is consequently
   enjoying an unprecedented level of unpopularity; there is even an
   <i>alt.lang.intercal</i> newsgroup devoted to the study and <small>...</small>
   appreciation of the language on Usenet.

<p>Inevitably, INTERCAL has a home page on the Web:
   <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/intercal/">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/intercal/</a>. An extended version,
   implemented in (what else?) <b><a href="#Perl">Perl</a></b> and adding object-oriented

<p><b>Internet</b> n.  <p>
 The mother of all networks.  First
   incarnated beginning in 1969 as the ARPANET, a U.S. Department of
   Defense research testbed.  Though it has been widely believed that
   the goal was to develop a network architecture for military
   command-and-control that could survive disruptions up to and
   including nuclear war, this is a myth; in fact, ARPANET was
   conceived from the start as a way to get most economical use out of
   then-scarce large-computer resources.

<p>As originally imagined, ARPANET's major use would have been to
   support what is now called remote login and more sophisticated
   forms of distributed computing, but the infant technology of
   electronic mail quickly grew to dominate actual usage. 
   Universities, research labs and defense contractors early
   discovered the Internet's potential as a medium of communication
   between <em>humans</em> and linked up in steadily increasing numbers,
   connecting together a quirky mix of academics, techies, hippies, SF
   fans, hackers, and anarchists.  The roots of this lexicon lie in
   those early years.

<p>Over the next quarter-century the Internet evolved in many
   ways. The typical machine/OS combination moved from <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b>
   <b><a href="#PDP-10">PDP-10</a></b>s and <b><a href="#PDP-20">PDP-20</a></b>s, running <b><a href="#TOPS-10">TOPS-10</a></b> and
   <b><a href="#TOPS-20">TOPS-20</a></b>, to PDP-11s and VAXes and Suns running <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b>, and
   in the 1990s to Unix on Intel microcomputers.  The Internet's
   protocols grew more capable, most notably in the move from NCP/IP
   to <b><a href="#TCP%2fIP">TCP/IP</a></b> in 1982 and the implementation of Domain Name
   Service in 1983.  It was around this time that people began
   referring to the collection of interconnected networks with ARPANET
   at its core as "the Internet".

<p>The ARPANET had a fairly strict set of participation guidelines -
   connected institutions had to be involved with a DOD-related
   research project.  By the mid-80s, many of the organizations
   clamoring to join didn't fit this profile.  In 1986, the National
   Science Foundation built NSFnet to open up access to its five
   regional supercomputing centers; NSFnet became the backbone of the
   Internet, replacing the original ARPANET pipes (which were formally
   shut down in 1990).  Between 1990 and late 1994 the pieces of
   NSFnet were sold to major telecommunications companies until
   the Internet backbone had gone completely commercial.

<p>That year, 1994, was also the year the mainstream culture
   discovered the Internet.  Once again, the <b><a href="#killer%20app">killer app</a></b> was not
   the anticipated one - rather, what caught the public imagination
   was the hypertext and multimedia features of the World Wide Web. 
   Subsequently the Internet has seen off its only serious challenger
   (the OSI protocol stack favored by European telecoms monopolies) and
   is in the process of absorbing into itself many of the proprietary
   networks built during the second wave of wide-area networking after
   1980.  By 1996 it had become a commonplace even in mainstream media
   to predict that a globally-extended Internet would become the key
   unifying communications technology of the next century. See also

<p><b>Internet address</b> n. <p>
 1. [techspeak] An absolute network
   address of the form <i>foo@bar.baz</i>, where foo is a user name, bar
   is a <b><a href="#sitename">sitename</a></b>, and baz is a `domain' name, possibly
   including periods itself.  Contrast with <b><a href="#bang%20path">bang path</a></b>; see also
   <b><a href="#the%20network">the network</a></b> and <b><a href="#network%20address">network address</a></b>.  All Internet machines
   and most UUCP sites can now resolve these addresses, thanks to a
   large amount of behind-the-scenes magic and <b><a href="#PD">PD</a></b> software
   written since 1980 or so.  See also <b><a href="#bang%20path">bang path</a></b>, <b><a href="#domainist">domainist</a></b>. 
   2. More loosely, any network address reachable through Internet;
   this includes <b><a href="#bang%20path">bang path</a></b> addresses and some internal corporate
   and government networks.

<p>Reading Internet addresses is something of an art.  Here are the
   four most important top-level functional Internet domains followed
   by a selection of geographical domains:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><i>com</i>
<dd>commercial organizations
<dt><i>edu</i>
<dd>educational institutions
<dt><i>gov</i>
<dd>U.S. government civilian sites
<dt><i>mil</i>
<dd>U.S. military sites
</dl>
</blockquote>


<br><p>
<p>Note that most of the sites in the <i>com</i> and <i>edu</i> domains are in
   the U.S. or Canada.

<br><p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><i>us</i>
<dd>sites in the U.S. outside the functional domains
<dt><i>su</i>
<dd>sites in the ex-Soviet Union (see <b><a href="#kremvax">kremvax</a></b>). 
<dt><i>uk</i>
<dd>sites in the United Kingdom
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Within the <i>us</i> domain, there are subdomains for the fifty
   states, each generally with a name identical to the state's postal
   abbreviation.  Within the <i>uk</i> domain, there is an <i>ac</i> subdomain for
   academic sites and a <i>co</i> domain for commercial ones.  Other
   top-level domains may be divided up in similar ways.

<p><b>ISO standard cup of tea</b> n. <p>
 [South Africa] A cup of tea
   with milk and one teaspoon of sugar, where the milk is poured into
   the cup before the tea.  Variations are ISO 0, with no sugar; ISO
   2, with two spoons of sugar; and so on. 
   This may derive from the "NATO standard" cup of coffee and tea
   (milk and two sugars), military slang going back to the late 1950s
   and parodying NATO's relentless bureacratic drive to standardize
   parts across European and U.S. militaries.

<p>Like many ISO standards, this one has a faintly alien ring in North
   America, where hackers generally shun the decadent British practice
   of adulterating perfectly good tea with dairy products and
   prefer instead to add a wedge of lemon, if anything.  If one were
   feeling extremely silly, one might hypothesize an analogous `ANSI
   standard cup of tea' and wind up with a political situation
   distressingly similar to several that arise in much more serious
   technical contexts.  (Milk and lemon don't mix very well.)

<p>[2000 update:  There is now, in fact, an ISO standard
   3103: `Method for preparation of a liquor of tea for use in sensory
   tests.', alleged to be equivalent to British Standard BS6008:
   `How to make a standard cup of tea.' - ESR]

<p><b>ITS</b> /I-T-S/ n. <p>
 1. Incompatible Time-sharing System,
   an influential though highly idiosyncratic operating system written
   for PDP-6s and PDP-10s at MIT and long used at the MIT AI Lab. 
   Much AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS folklore, and to have been
   `an ITS hacker' qualifies one instantly as an old-timer of the
   most venerable sort.  ITS pioneered many important innovations,
   including transparent file sharing between machines and
   terminal-independent I/O.  After about 1982, most actual work was
   shifted to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run
   essentially as a hobby and service to the hacker community.  The
   shutdown of the lab's last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end
   of an era and sent old-time hackers into mourning nationwide (see
   <b><a href="#high%20moby">high moby</a></b>).  2. A mythical image of operating-system
   perfection worshiped by a bizarre, fervent retro-cult of old-time
   hackers and ex-users (see <b><a href="#troglodyte">troglodyte</a></b>, sense 2).  ITS
   worshipers manage somehow to continue believing that an OS
   maintained by assembly-language hand-hacking that supported only

<p><b>Java</b> <p>
 An object-oriented language originally developed at
   Sun by James Gosling (and known by the name "Oak") with the
   intention of being the successor to <b><a href="#C++">C++</a></b> (the project was
   however originally sold to Sun as an embedded language for use in
   set-top boxes).  After the great Internet explosion of 1993-1994,
   Java was hacked into a byte-interpreted language and became the focus
   of a relentless hype campaign by Sun, which touted it as the new
   language of choice for distributed applications.

<p>Java is indeed a stronger and cleaner design than C++ and has been
   embraced by many in the hacker community - but it has been a
   considerable source of frustration to many others, for reasons
   ranging from uneven support on different Web browser platforms,
   performance issues, and some notorious deficiencies in some of the
   standard toolkits (AWT in particular).  <b><a href="#Microsoft">Microsoft</a></b>'s determined
   attempts to corrupt the language (which it rightly sees as a threat
   to its OS monopoly) have not helped.  As of 2001, these issues are
   still in the process of being resolved.

<p>Despite many attractive features and a good design, it is difficult
   to find people willing to praise Java who have tried to implement a
   complex, real-world system with it (but to be fair it is early days
   yet, and no other language has ever been forced to spend its
   childhood under the limelight the way Java has).  On the other
   hand, Java has already been a big <b><a href="#win">win</a></b> in academic circles,
   where it has taken the place of <b><a href="#Pascal">Pascal</a></b> as the preferred tool
   for teaching the basics of good programming to the next generation

 1. IBM's supremely <b><a href="#rude">rude</a></b> Job Control
   Language.  JCL is the script language used to control the execution

   syntax, and some versions will, for example, <b><a href="#barf">barf</a></b> if two
   spaces appear where it expects one.  Most programmers confronted
   with JCL simply copy a working file (or card deck), changing the
   file names.  Someone who actually understands and generates unique
   JCL is regarded with the mixed respect one gives to someone who
   memorizes the phone book.  It is reported that hackers at IBM
   itself sometimes sing "Who's the breeder of the crud that mangles
   you and me?  I-B-M, J-C-L, M-o-u-s-e" to the tune of the
   "Mickey Mouse Club" theme to express their opinion of the

   people in the Usenet newsgroup <i>rec.humor.funny</i> tended to use

   (The practice was <b><a href="#retcon">retcon</a></b>ned by expanding these initials as

   faded away; this term appears to be doing likewise.  JEDR's only

<p><b>killer app</b>  <p>
 The application that actually makes a sustaining
   market for a promising but under-utilized technology.  First used
   in the mid-1980s to describe Lotus 1-2-3 once it became evident
   that demand for that product had been the major driver of the early
   business market for IBM PCs.  The term was then restrospectively
   applied to VisiCalc, which had played a similar role in the success
   of the Apple II.  After 1994 it became commonplace to describe the
   World Wide Web as the Internet's killer app.  One of the standard
   questions asked about each new personal-computer technology as it
   emerges has become "what's the killer app?"

<p><b>killer micro</b> n. <p>
 [popularized by Eugene Brooks] A
   microprocessor-based machine that infringes on mini, mainframe, or
   supercomputer performance turf.  Often heard in "No one will
   survive the attack of the killer micros!", the battle cry of the
   downsizers.  Used esp. of RISC architectures.

<p>The popularity of the phrase `attack of the killer micros' is
   doubtless reinforced by the title of the movie "Attack Of The
   Killer Tomatoes" (one of the <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b> examples of
   so-bad-it's-wonderful among hackers).  This has even more
   <b><a href="#flavor">flavor</a></b> now that killer micros have gone on the offensive not
   just individually (in workstations) but in hordes (within massively
   parallel computers).

<p>[1996 update: Eugene Brooks was right.  Since this term first
   entered the Jargon File in 1990, the minicomputer has effectively
   vanished, the <b><a href="#mainframe">mainframe</a></b> sector is in deep and apparently
   terminal decline (with IBM but a shadow of its former self), and
   even the supercomputer business has contracted into a smaller
   niche.  It's networked killer micros as far as the eye can see.

<p><b>kludge</b> 1. /klooj/ n. <p>
 Incorrect (though regrettably
   common) spelling of <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b> (US).  These two words have been
   confused in American usage since the early 1960s, and widely
   confounded in Great Britain since the end of World War II. 
   2. [TMRC] A <b><a href="#crock">crock</a></b> that works. (A long-ago "Datamation"
   article by Jackson Granholme similarly said: "An ill-assorted
   collection of poorly matching parts, forming a distressing
   whole.")  3. v. To use a kludge to get around a problem.  "I've
   kludged around it for now, but I'll fix it up properly later."

<p>This word appears to have derived from Scots `kludge' or
   `kludgie' for a common toilet, via British military slang.  It
   apparently became confused with U.S. <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b> during or after
   World War II; some Britons from that era use both words in
   definably different ways, but <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b> is now uncommon in Great
   Britain.  `Kludge' in Commonwealth hackish differs in meaning from
   `kluge' in that it lacks the positive senses; a kludge is something
   no Commonwealth hacker wants to be associated too closely with. 
   Also, `kludge' is more widely known in British mainstream slang
   than `kluge' is in the U.S.

<p><b>kluge</b> /klooj/ <p>
 [from the German `klug', clever; poss. 
   related to Polish `klucz' (a key, a hint, a main point)]
   1. n. A Rube Goldberg (or Heath Robinson) device, whether in
   hardware or software.  2. n. A clever programming trick
   intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not
   clear, manner.  Often used to repair bugs.  Often involves
   <b><a href="#ad-hockery">ad-hockery</a></b> and verges on being a <b><a href="#crock">crock</a></b>.  3. n. 
   Something that works for the wrong reason.  4. vt.  To insert a
   kluge into a program.  "I've kluged this routine to get around
   that weird bug, but there's probably a better way."  5. [WPI]
   n. A feature that is implemented in a <b><a href="#rude">rude</a></b> manner.

<p>Nowadays this term is often encountered in the variant spelling
   `kludge'.  Reports from <b><a href="#old%20fart">old fart</a></b>s are consistent that
   `kluge' was the original spelling, reported around computers as
   far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used exclusively of
   <em>hardware</em> kluges.  In 1947, the "New York Folklore
   Quarterly" reported a classic shaggy-dog story `Murgatroyd the
   Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces, in which a `kluge'
   was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function.  Other
   sources report that `kluge' was common Navy slang in the WWII era
   for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but
   consistently failed at sea.

<p>However, there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade
   older.  Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of
   a device called a "Kluge paper feeder", an adjunct to mechanical
   printing presses.  Legend has it that the Kluge feeder was designed
   before small, cheap electric motors and control electronics; it
   relied on a fiendishly complex assortment of cams, belts, and
   linkages to both power and synchronize all its operations from one
   motive driveshaft.  It was accordingly temperamental, subject to
   frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair -- but oh,
   so clever!  People who tell this story also aver that `Kluge' was
   the name of a design engineer.

<p>There is in fact a Brandtjen &amp; Kluge Inc., an old family business
   that manufactures printing equipment - interestingly, their name
   is pronounced /kloo'gee/!  Henry Brandtjen, president of the
   firm, told me (ESR, 1994) that his company was co-founded by his
   father and an engineer named Kluge /kloo'gee/, who built and
   co-designed the original Kluge automatic feeder in 1919. 
   Mr. Brandtjen claims, however, that this was a <em>simple</em> device
   (with only four cams); he says he has no idea how the myth of its
   complexity took hold.  Other correspondents differ with
   Mr. Brandtjen's history of the device and his allegation that it
   was a simple rather than complex one, but agree that the Kluge
   automatic feeder was the most likely source of the folklore.

<p><b><a href="#TMRC">TMRC</a></b> and the MIT hacker culture of the early '60s seems to
   have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII
   military slang (see also <b><a href="#foobar">foobar</a></b>).  It seems likely that
   `kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics
   projects that had been located in Cambridge (many in MIT's
   venerable Building 20, in which <b><a href="#TMRC">TMRC</a></b> is also located) during
   the war.

<p>The variant `kludge' was apparently popularized by the
   <b><a href="#Datamation">Datamation</a></b> article mentioned above; it was titled "How
   to Design a Kludge" (February 1962, pp. 30, 31).  This spelling was
   probably imported from Great Britain, where <b><a href="#kludge">kludge</a></b> has an
   independent history (though this fact was largely unknown to
   hackers on either side of the Atlantic before a mid-1993 debate in
   the Usenet group <i>alt.folklore.computers</i> over the First and
   Second Edition versions of this entry; everybody used to think
   <b><a href="#kludge">kludge</a></b> was just a mutation of <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b>).  It now appears that
   the British, having forgotten the etymology of their own `kludge'
   when `kluge' crossed the Atlantic, repaid the U.S. by lobbing the
   `kludge' orthography in the other direction and confusing their
   American cousins' spelling!

<p>The result of this history is a tangle.  Many younger U.S. hackers
   pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its
   meaning and pronunciation, as `kludge'. (Phonetically, consider
   huge, refuge, centrifuge, and deluge as opposed to sludge, judge,
   budge, and fudge.  Whatever its failings in other areas, English
   spelling is perfectly consistent about this distinction.)  British
   hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted
   negative sense and are at least consistent.  European hackers have
   mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to
   pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning!

<p>Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's
   meaning.

<p><b>kook</b> <p>
 [Usenet; originally and more formally, `net.kook']
   Term used to describe a regular poster who continually posts
   messages with no apparent grounding in reality.  Different from a
   <b><a href="#troll">troll</a></b>, which implies a sort of sly wink on the part of a
   poster who knows better, kooks really believe what they write, to the
   extent that they believe anything.

<p>The kook trademark is paranoia and grandiosity.  Kooks will often
   build up elaborate imaginary support structures, fake corporations
   and the like, and continue to act as if those things are real even
   after their falsity has been documented in public.

<p>While they may appear harmless, and are usually filtered out by the
   other regular participants in a newsgroup of mailing list, they can
   still cause problems because the necessity for these measures is
   not immediately apparent to newcomers; there are several instances
   on record, for example, of journalists writing stories with quotes
   from kooks who caught them unaware.

<p><b>Kool Aid, to drink the</b> <p>
 [from a kid's sugar-enriched drink in
   fruity flavors] When someone who should know better succumbs to
   marketing influences and actually begins to believe the propaganda
   being dished out by a vendor.  Usually the decortication process is
   slow and almost unnoticeable until one day the victim emerges as a
   True Believer and begins spreading the faith himself.  The term
   originates in the suicide of 914 followers of Jim Jones's People's
   Temple cult in Guyana in 1978.  What they actually drank was
   cyanide-laced Flavor-Aid, a cheap knockoff rather than Kool-Aid
   itself.  There is a <a href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/wais/html/na-dir/food/kool-aid-faq.html">FAQ</a> on

<p><b>kremvax</b> /krem-vaks/ n. <p>
 [from the then-large number of
   <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b> <b><a href="#VAXen">VAXen</a></b> with names of the form <i>foovax</i>]
   Originally, a fictitious Usenet site at the Kremlin, announced on
   April 1, 1984 in a posting ostensibly originated there by Soviet
   leader Konstantin Chernenko.  The posting was actually forged by
   Piet Beertema as an April Fool's joke.  Other fictitious sites
   mentioned in the hoax were <i>moskvax</i> and <b><a href="#kgbvax">kgbvax</a></b>.  This was
   probably the funniest of the many April Fool's forgeries
   perpetrated on Usenet (which has negligible security against them),
   because the notion that Usenet might ever penetrate the Iron
   Curtain seemed so totally absurd at the time.

<p>In fact, it was only six years later that the first genuine site in
   Moscow, <i>demos.su</i>, joined Usenet.  Some readers needed
   convincing that the postings from it weren't just another prank. 
   Vadim Antonov, senior programmer at Demos and the major poster from
   there up to mid-1991, was quite aware of all this, referred to it
   frequently in his own postings, and at one point twitted some
   credulous readers by blandly asserting that he <em>was</em> a
   hoax!

<p>Eventually he even arranged to have the domain's gateway site
   named <i>kremvax</i>, thus neatly turning fiction into fact
   and demonstrating that the hackish sense of humor transcends
   cultural barriers.  [Mr. Antonov also contributed the
   Russian-language material for this lexicon. --ESR]

<p>In an even more ironic historical footnote, <i>kremvax</i> became an
   electronic center of the anti-communist resistance during the
   bungled hard-line coup of August 1991.  During those three days the
   Soviet UUCP network centered on <i>kremvax</i> became the only
   trustworthy news source for many places within the USSR.  Though
   the sysops were concentrating on internal communications,
   cross-border postings included immediate transliterations of Boris
   Yeltsin's decrees condemning the coup and eyewitness reports of the
   demonstrations in Moscow's streets.  In those hours, years of
   speculation that totalitarianism would prove unable to maintain its
   grip on politically-loaded information in the age of computer
   networking were proved devastatingly accurate -- and the original
   <i>kremvax</i> joke became a reality as Yeltsin and the new Russian
   revolutionaries of `glasnost' and `perestroika' made
   <i>kremvax</i> one of the timeliest means of their outreach to the
   West.

 A <b><a href="#punched%20card">punched card</a></b> with all holes
   punched (also called a `whoopee card' or `ventilator card'). 
   Card readers tended to jam when they got to one of these, as the
   resulting card had too little structural strength to avoid buckling
   inside the mechanism.  Card punches could also jam trying to
   produce these things owing to power-supply problems.  When some
   practical joker fed a lace card through the reader, you needed to
   clear the jam with a `card knife' -- which you used on the joker
   first.

   but who never uploads. (Also known as `leecher').  Oppose
   <b><a href="#elite">elite</a></b>.  Has the same connotations of self-conscious elitism
   that use of <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b> does among hackers.  2. Someone who tries to
   crack a BBS.  3. Someone who annoys the sysop or other BBS users -
   for instance, by posting lots of silly messages, uploading
   virus-ridden software, frequently dropping carrier, etc.

<p>Crackers also use it to refer to cracker <b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b>s. In phreak
   culture, a lamer is one who scams codes off others rather than
   doing cracks or really understanding the fundamental concepts.  In
   <b><a href="#warez%20d00dz">warez d00dz</a></b> culture, where the ability to wave around cracked
   commercial software within days of (or before) release to the
   commercial market is much esteemed, the lamer might try to upload
   garbage or shareware or something incredibly old (old in this
   context is read as a few years to anything older than 3
   days).  `Lamer' is also much used in the IRC world in a similar sense to
   the above.

<p>This term originated among Amiga crackers of the mid-1980s.  It was
   popularized there by `Lamer Exterminator', the most famous and
   feared Amiga virus ever, which gradually corrupted
   non-write-protected floppy disks with bad sectors. The bad sectors,
   when looked at, were overwritten with repetitions of the string `LAMER!'.

<p><b>LAN party</b> /lan par'tee/ <p>
 An event to which several users
   bring their boxes and hook them up to a common LAN (Local Area
   Network), often for the purpose of playing multiplayer computer
   games, especially action games such as Quake or Unreal Tournament. 
   This is also a good venue for people to show-off their fancy new
   hardware.  Such events can get pretty large, several hundred people
   attend the annual QuakeCon in Texas.  The theoretical rationale
   behind LAN parties is that playing over the Internet often
   introduces too much lag in the playing experience - but just as
   important is the special quality of trash-talking each other across
   the room while playing, and the instinctive social ritual of
   consuming vast amounts of food and drink together.

<p><b>larval stage</b> n. <p>

   concentration on coding apparently passed through by all fledgling
   hackers.  Common symptoms include the perpetration of more than one
   36-hour <b><a href="#hacking%20run">hacking run</a></b> in a given week; neglect of all other
   activities including usual basics like food, sleep, and personal
   hygiene; and a chronic case of advanced bleary-eye.  Can last from
   6 months to 2 years, the apparent median being around 18 months.  A
   few so afflicted never resume a more `normal' life, but the
   ordeal seems to be necessary to produce really wizardly (as opposed
   to merely competent) programmers.  See also <b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b>.  A less

<p><b>laser chicken</b> n. <p>
 Kung Pao Chicken, a standard Chinese dish
   containing chicken, peanuts, and hot red peppers in a spicy
   pepper-oil sauce.  Many hackers call it `laser chicken' for two
   reasons: It can <b><a href="#zap">zap</a></b> you just like a laser, and the sauce has a
   red color reminiscent of some laser beams.  The dish has also been
   called `gunpowder chicken'.

<p>In a variation on this theme, it is reported that some Australian
   hackers have redesignated the common dish `lemon chicken' as
   `Chernobyl Chicken'.  The name is derived from the color of the
   sauce, which is considered bright enough to glow in the dark (as,

<p><b>life</b> n. <p>
 1. A cellular-automata game invented by John Horton
   Conway and first introduced publicly by Martin Gardner
   ("Scientific American", October 1970); the game's popularity
   had to wait a few years for computers on which it could reasonably
   be played, as it's no fun to simulate the cells by hand.  Many
   hackers pass through a stage of fascination with it, and hackers at
   various places contributed heavily to the mathematical analysis of
   this game (most notably Bill Gosper at MIT, who even implemented
   life in <b><a href="#TECO">TECO</a></b>!; see <b><a href="#Gosperism">Gosperism</a></b>).  When a hacker mentions

 Used to describe a task

<p>Hacker use of this term may recall mainstream slang
   originated early in the 20th century by President Theodore
   Roosevelt.  There is a legend that, weary of inconclusive talks
   with Colombia over the right to dig a canal through its
   then-province Panama, he remarked, "Negotiating with those pirates
   is like trying to nail currant jelly to the wall."  Roosevelt's
   government subsequently encouraged the anti-Colombian insurgency

<p><b>line eater, the</b> n. obs. <p>
 [Usenet] 1. A bug in some
   now-obsolete versions of the netnews software that used to eat up
   to BUFSIZ bytes of the article text.  The bug was triggered by
   having the text of the article start with a space or tab.  This bug
   was quickly personified as a mythical creature called the `line
   eater', and postings often included a dummy line of `line eater
   food'.  Ironically, line eater `food' not beginning with a space
   or tab wasn't actually eaten, since the bug was avoided; but if
   there <em>was</em> a space or tab before it, then the line eater
   would eat the food <em>and</em> the beginning of the text it was
   supposed to be protecting.  The practice of `sacrificing to the
   line eater' continued for some time after the bug had been
   <b><a href="#nailed%20to%20the%20wall">nailed to the wall</a></b>, and is still humorously referred to.  The

<p><b>line starve</b> <p>
 [MIT] 1. vi. To feed paper through a printer
   the wrong way by one line (most printers can't do this).  On a
   display terminal, to move the cursor up to the previous line of the
   screen.  "To print `X squared', you just output `X', line starve,
   `2', line feed."  (The line starve causes the `2' to appear on the
   line above the `X', and the line feed gets back to the original
   line.)  2. n. A character (or character sequence) that causes a
   terminal to perform this action.  ASCII 0011010, also called SUB or
   control-Z, was one common line-starve character in the days before
   microcomputers and the X3.64 terminal standard.  Today, the term
   might be used for the ISO reverse line feed character 0x8D. Unlike

<p><b>link farm</b> n. <p>
 [Unix] A directory tree that contains many

   save space when one is maintaining several nearly identical copies
   of the same source tree -- for example, when the only difference
   is architecture-dependent object files.  "Let's freeze the source
   and then rebuild the FROBOZZ-3 and FROBOZZ-4 link farms."  Link
   farms may also be used to get around restrictions on the number of
   <code>-I</code> (include-file directory) arguments on older C
   preprocessors.  However, they can also get completely out of hand,
   becoming the filesystem equivalent of <b><a href="#spaghetti%20code">spaghetti code</a></b>.

<p><b>Linux</b> /lee'nuhks/ or /li'nuks/, <em>not</em> /li:'nuhks/
   n. <p>
 The free Unix workalike created by Linus Torvalds and
   friends starting about 1991. The pronunciation /li'nuhks/ is
   preferred because the name `Linus' has an /ee/ sound in Swedish
   (Linus's family is part of Finland's 6% ethnic-Swedish minority)
   and Linus considers English short /i/ to be closer to /ee/ than
   English long /i:/.  This may be the most remarkable hacker
   project in history -- an entire clone of Unix for 386, 486 and
   Pentium micros, distributed for free with sources over the net
   (ports to Alpha and Sparc and many other machines are also in use).

<p>Linux is what <b><a href="#GNU">GNU</a></b> aimed to be, and it relies on the GNU toolset. 
   But the Free Software Foundation didn't produce the kernel to go with
   that toolset until 1999, which was too late.  Other, similar efforts
   like FreeBSD and NetBSD have been technically successful but never
   caught fire the way Linux has; as this is written in 2001, Linux is
   seriously challenging Microsoft's OS dominance. It has already
   captured 31% of the Internet-server market and 25% of general
   business servers.

<p>An earlier version of this entry opined "The secret of Linux's
   success seems to be that Linus worked much harder early on to keep
   the development process open and recruit other hackers, creating a
   snowball effect."  Truer than we knew.  See <b><a href="#bazaar">bazaar</a></b>.

<p>(Some people object that the name `Linux' should be used to
   refer only to the kernel, not the entire operating system.  This
   claim is a proxy for an underlying territorial dispute; people who
   insist on the term `GNU/Linux' want the <b><a href="#FSF">FSF</a></b> to get most
   of the credit for Linux because RMS and friends wrote many of its
   user-level tools.  Neither this theory nor the term `GNU/Linux'
   has gained more than minority acceptance).

   about two lions who, escaping from the zoo, split up to increase

<p><b>Lions Book</b> n. <p>
 "Source Code and Commentary on Unix
   level 6", by John Lions.  The two parts of this book contained (1)
   the entire source listing of the Unix Version 6 kernel, and (2) a
   commentary on the source discussing the algorithms.  These were
   circulated internally at the University of New South Wales
   beginning 1976-77, and were, for years after, the <em>only</em>
   detailed kernel documentation available to anyone outside Bell
   Labs.  Because Western Electric wished to maintain trade secret
   status on the kernel, the Lions Book was only supposed to be
   distributed to affiliates of source licensees.  In spite of this,
   it soon spread by <b><a href="#samizdat">samizdat</a></b> to a good many of the early Unix
   hackers.

<p>[1996 update: The Lions book lives again! It was put back in print

<p><b>LISP</b> n. <p>
 [from `LISt Processing language', but mythically
   from `Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses'] AI's mother
   tongue, a language based on the ideas of (a) variable-length lists
   and trees as fundamental data types, and (b) the interpretation of
   code as data and vice-versa.  Invented by John McCarthy at MIT in
   the late 1950s, it is actually older than any other <b><a href="#HLL">HLL</a></b> still
   in use except FORTRAN.  Accordingly, it has undergone considerable
   adaptive radiation over the years; modern variants are quite
   different in detail from the original LISP 1.5.  The dominant HLL
   among hackers until the early 1980s, LISP now shares the throne
   with <b><a href="#C">C</a></b>.  Its partisans claim it is the only language that is
   truly beautiful.  See <b><a href="#languages%20of%20choice">languages of choice</a></b>.

<p>All LISP functions and programs are expressions that return
   values; this, together with the high memory utilization of LISPs,
   gave rise to Alan Perlis's famous quip (itself a take on an Oscar
   Wilde quote) that "LISP programmers know the value of everything
   and the cost of nothing".

<p>One significant application for LISP has been as a proof by example
   that most newer languages, such as <b><a href="#COBOL">COBOL</a></b> and <b><a href="#Ada">Ada</a></b>, are full
   of unnecessary <b><a href="#crock">crock</a></b>s.  When the <b><a href="#Right%20Thing">Right Thing</a></b> has already

 Describes a computer architecture in

   The PDP-11 and VAX families of computers and Intel microprocessors

<p><b>live</b> /li:v/ adj.,adv. <p>
 [common] Opposite of `test'. 
   Refers to actual real-world data or a program working with it.  For
   example, the response to "I think the record deleter is finished"
   might be "Is it live yet?" or "Have you tried it out on live
   data?"  This usage usually carries the connotation that live data
   is more fragile and must not be corrupted, or bad things will
   happen.  So a more appropriate response might be: "Well, make sure
   it works perfectly before we throw live data at it."  The
   implication here is that record deletion is something pretty
   significant, and a haywire record-deleter running amok live would
   probably cause great harm.

<p><b>live data</b> n. <p>
 1. Data that is written to be interpreted and
   takes over program flow when triggered by some un-obvious
   operation, such as viewing it.  One use of such hacks is to break
   security.  For example, some smart terminals have commands that
   allow one to download strings to program keys; this can be used to
   write live data that, when listed to the terminal, infects it with
   a security-breaking <b><a href="#virus">virus</a></b> that is triggered the next time a

<p><b>Live Free Or Die!</b> imp. <p>
 1. The state motto of New
   Hampshire, which appears on that state's automobile license plates. 
   2. A slogan associated with Unix in the romantic days when Unix
   aficionados saw themselves as a tiny, beleaguered underground
   tilting against the windmills of industry.  The "free" referred
   specifically to freedom from the <b><a href="#fascist">fascist</a></b> design philosophies
   and crufty misfeatures common on competing operating systems. 
   Armando Stettner, one of the early Unix developers, used to give

<p><b>logical</b> adj. <p>
 [from the technical term `logical device',
   wherein a physical device is referred to by an arbitrary
   `logical' name] Having the role of.  If a person (say, Les
   Earnest at SAIL) who had long held a certain post left and were
   replaced, the replacement would for a while be known as the
   `logical' Les Earnest.  (This does not imply any judgment on the
   replacement.)  Compare <b><a href="#virtual">virtual</a></b>.

<p>At Stanford, `logical' compass directions denote a coordinate
   system relative to El Camino Real, in which `logical north' is
   always toward San Francisco and `logical south' is always toward
   San Jose-in spite of the fact that El Camino Real runs physical
   north/south near San Francisco, physical east/west near San Jose,
   and along a curve everywhere in between. (The best rule of thumb
   here is that, by definition, El Camino Real always runs logical
   north-south.)

<p>In giving directions, one might say: "To get to Rincon Tarasco
   restaurant, get onto <b><a href="#El%20Camino%20Bignum">El Camino Bignum</a></b> going logical north." 
   Using the word `logical' helps to prevent the recipient from
   worrying about that the fact that the sun is setting almost
   directly in front of him.  The concept is reinforced by North
   American highways which are almost, but not quite, consistently
   labeled with logical rather than physical directions.  A similar
   situation exists at MIT: Route 128 (famous for the electronics
   industry that grew up along it) wraps roughly 3 quarters
   around Boston at a radius of 10 miles, terminating near the
   coastline at each end.  It would be most precise to describe the
   two directions along this highway as `clockwise' and
   `counterclockwise', but the road signs all say "north" and
   "south", respectively.  A hacker might describe these directions
   as `logical north' and `logical south', to indicate that they
   are conventional directions not corresponding to the usual
   denotation for those words.

<p><b>loss</b> n. <p>
 Something (not a person) that loses; a situation in
   which something is losing.  Emphatic forms include `moby loss',
   and `total loss', `complete loss'.  Common interjections are
   "What a loss!"  and "What a moby loss!"  Note that `moby
   loss' is OK even though **`moby loser' is not used; applied to an
   abstract noun, moby is simply a magnifier, whereas when applied to
   a person it implies substance and has positive connotations.

<p><b>lossage</b> /los'*j/ n. <p>
 [very common] The result of a bug
   or malfunction.  This is a mass or collective noun.  "What a
   loss!" and "What lossage!" are nearly synonymous.  The former is
   slightly more particular to the speaker's present circumstances;
   the latter implies a continuing <b><a href="#lose">lose</a></b> of which the speaker is
   currently a victim.  Thus (for example) a temporary hardware
   failure is a loss, but bugs in an important tool (like a compiler)
   are serious lossage.

 Syn. <b><a href="#lost%20in%20the%20underflow">lost in the underflow</a></b>. 
   This term is from signal processing, where signals of very small
   amplitude cannot be separated from low-intensity noise in the

<p><b>lost in the underflow</b> adj. <p>
 Too small to be worth
   considering; more specifically, small beyond the limits of accuracy
   or measurement.  This is a reference to `floating underflow', a
   condition that can occur when a floating-point arithmetic processor
   tries to handle quantities smaller than its limit of magnitude.  It
   is also a pun on `undertow' (a kind of fast, cold current that
   sometimes runs just offshore and can be dangerous to swimmers). 
   "Well, sure, photon pressure from the stadium lights alters the
   path of a thrown baseball, but that effect gets lost in the
   underflow."  Compare <b><a href="#epsilon">epsilon</a></b>, <b><a href="#epsilon%20squared">epsilon squared</a></b>; see also

<p><b>lurker</b> n. <p>
 One of the `silent majority' in an electronic
   forum; one who posts occasionally or not at all but is known to
   read the group's postings regularly.  This term is not pejorative
   and indeed is casually used reflexively: "Oh, I'm just lurking." 
   Often used in `the lurkers', the hypothetical audience for the
   group's <b><a href="#flamage">flamage</a></b>-emitting regulars.  When a lurker speaks up
   for the first time, this is called `delurking'.

<p>The creator of the popular science-fiction TV series "Babylon
   5" has ties to SF fandom and the hacker culture.  In that series,
   the use of the term `lurker' for a homeless or displaced person is
   a conscious reference to the jargon term.

<p><b>luser</b> /loo'zr/ n. <p>
 [common] A <b><a href="#user">user</a></b>; esp. one
   who is also a <b><a href="#loser">loser</a></b>.  (<b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b> and <b><a href="#loser">loser</a></b> are
   pronounced identically.)  This word was coined around 1975 at MIT. 
   Under ITS, when you first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed
   Control-Z to get the computer's attention, it printed out some
   status information, including how many people were already using
   the computer; it might print "14 users", for example.  Someone
   thought it would be a great joke to patch the system to print "14
   losers" instead.  There ensued a great controversy, as some of the
   users didn't particularly want to be called losers to their faces
   every time they used the computer.  For a while several hackers
   struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the back of
   the others; any time you logged into the computer it was even money
   whether it would say "users" or "losers".  Finally, someone
   tried the compromise "lusers", and it stuck.  Later one of the
   ITS machines supported <code>luser</code> as a request-for-help command. 
   ITS died the death in mid-1990, except as a museum piece; the usage
   lives on, however, and the term `luser' is often seen in program
   comments and on Usenet.  Compare <b><a href="#mundane">mundane</a></b>, <b><a href="#muggle">muggle</a></b>.

<p><b>macro</b> /mak'roh/ n. <p>
 [techspeak] A name (possibly followed
   by a formal <b><a href="#arg">arg</a></b> list) that is equated to a text or symbolic
   expression to which it is to be expanded (possibly with the
   substitution of actual arguments) by a macro expander.  This
   definition can be found in any technical dictionary; what those
   won't tell you is how the hackish connotations of the term have
   changed over time.

<p>The term `macro' originated in early assemblers, which encouraged
   the use of macros as a structuring and information-hiding device. 
   During the early 1970s, macro assemblers became ubiquitous, and
   sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as <b><a href="#HLL">HLL</a></b>s, only to fall
   from favor as improving compiler technology marginalized assembler
   programming (see <b><a href="#languages%20of%20choice">languages of choice</a></b>).  Nowadays the term is
   most often used in connection with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one
   of several special-purpose languages built around a macro-expansion
   facility (such as TeX or Unix's [nt]roff suite).

<p>Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective
   `macros' is now sometimes used for code in any special-purpose
   application control language (whether or not the language is
   actually translated by text expansion), and for macro-like entities
   such as the `keyboard macros' supported in some text editors
   (and PC TSR or Macintosh INIT/CDEV keyboard enhancers).

<p><b>magic</b> <p>
 1. adj. As yet unexplained, or too complicated to
   explain; compare <b><a href="#automagically">automagically</a></b> and (Arthur C.) Clarke's Third
   Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
   from magic."  "TTY echoing is controlled by a large number of
   magic bits."  "This routine magically computes the parity of an
   8-bit byte in three instructions."  2. adj. Characteristic of
   something that works although no one really understands why (this
   is especially called <b><a href="#black%20magic">black magic</a></b>).  3. n. [Stanford] A
   feature not generally publicized that allows something otherwise
   impossible, or a feature formerly in that category but now
   unveiled.  4. n.  The ultimate goal of all engineering &amp;
   development, elegance in the extreme; from the first corollary to
   Clarke's Third Law: "Any technology distinguishable from magic is
   insufficiently advanced".

<p>Parodies playing on these senses of the term abound; some have made
   their way into serious documentation, as when a MAGIC directive was

<p><b>magic cookie</b> n. <p>
 [Unix; common] 1. Something passed
   between routines or programs that enables the receiver to perform
   some operation; a capability ticket or opaque identifier. 
   Especially used of small data objects that contain data encoded in
   a strange or intrinsically machine-dependent way.  E.g., on
   non-Unix OSes with a non-byte-stream model of files, the result of
   <code>ftell(3)</code> may be a magic cookie rather than a byte offset; it
   can be passed to <code>fseek(3)</code>, but not operated on in any
   meaningful way.  The phrase `it hands you a magic cookie' means
   it returns a result whose contents are not defined but which can be
   passed back to the same or some other program later.  2. An in-band
   code for changing graphic rendition (e.g., inverse video or
   underlining) or performing other control functions (see also
   <b><a href="#cookie">cookie</a></b>).  Some older terminals would leave a blank on the
   screen corresponding to mode-change magic cookies; this was also
   called a <b><a href="#glitch">glitch</a></b> (or occasionally a `turd'; compare <b><a href="#mouse%20droppings">mouse droppings</a></b>).  See also <b><a href="#cookie">cookie</a></b>.

<p><b>magic number</b> n. <p>
 [Unix/C; common] 1. In source code,
   some non-obvious constant whose value is significant to the
   operation of a program and that is inserted inconspicuously in-line
   (<b><a href="#hardcoded">hardcoded</a></b>), rather than expanded in by a symbol set by a
   commented <code>#define</code>.  Magic numbers in this sense are bad
   style.  2. A number that encodes critical information used in an
   algorithm in some opaque way.  The classic examples of these are
   the numbers used in hash or CRC functions, or the coefficients in a
   linear congruential generator for pseudo-random numbers.  This
   sense actually predates and was ancestral to the more common sense
   1.  3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file
   to indicate its type to a utility.  Under Unix, the system and
   various applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish
   between types of executable file by looking for a magic number. 
   Once upon a time, these magic numbers were PDP-11 branch
   instructions that skipped over header data to the start of
   executable code; 0407, for example, was octal for `branch 16 bytes
   relative'.  Many other kinds of files now have magic numbers
   somewhere; some magic numbers are, in fact, strings, like the
   <code>!&lt;arch&gt;</code> at the beginning of a Unix archive file or the
   <code>%!</code> leading PostScript files.  Nowadays only a <b><a href="#wizard">wizard</a></b>
   knows the spells to create magic numbers.  How do you choose a
   fresh magic number of your own?  Simple -- you pick one at random. 
   See?  It's magic!

<p><em>The</em> magic number, on the other hand, is 7+/-2.  See
   "The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on
   our capacity for processing information" by George Miller, in the
   "Psychological Review" 63:81-97 (1956).  This classic paper
   established the number of distinct items (such as numeric digits)
   that humans can hold in short-term memory.  Among other things,
   this strongly influenced the interface design of the phone system.

<p><b>magic smoke</b> n. <p>
 A substance trapped inside IC packages that
   enables them to function (also called `blue smoke'; this is
   similar to the archaic `phlogiston' hypothesis about
   combustion).  Its existence is demonstrated by what happens when a
   chip burns up -- the magic smoke gets let out, so it doesn't work
   any more.  See <b><a href="#smoke%20test">smoke test</a></b>, <b><a href="#let%20the%20smoke%20out">let the smoke out</a></b>.

<p>Usenetter Jay Maynard tells the following story: "Once, while
   hacking on a dedicated Z80 system, I was testing code by blowing
   EPROMs and plugging them in the system, then seeing what happened. 
   One time, I plugged one in backwards.  I only discovered that
   <em>after</em> I realized that Intel didn't put power-on lights under
   the quartz windows on the tops of their EPROMs -- the die was
   glowing white-hot.  Amazingly, the EPROM worked fine after I erased
   it, filled it full of zeros, then erased it again.  For all I know,
   it's still in service.  Of course, this is because the magic smoke
   didn't get let out."  Compare the original phrasing of <b><a href="#Murphy's%20Law">Murphy's Law</a></b>.

<p><b>mailing list</b> n. <p>
 (often shortened in context to `list')
   1. An <b><a href="#email">email</a></b> address that is an alias (or <b><a href="#macro">macro</a></b>, though
   that word is never used in this connection) for many other email
   addresses.  Some mailing lists are simple `reflectors',
   redirecting mail sent to them to the list of recipients.  Others
   are filtered by humans or programs of varying degrees of
   sophistication; lists filtered by humans are said to be
   `moderated'.  2. The people who receive your email when you send
   it to such an address.

<p>Mailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker interaction,
   along with <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b>.  They predate Usenet, having originated
   with the first UUCP and ARPANET connections.  They are often used
   for private information-sharing on topics that would be too
   specialized for or inappropriate to public Usenet groups.  Though
   some of these maintain almost purely technical content (such as the
   Internet Engineering Task Force mailing list), others (like the
   `sf-lovers' list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe) are
   recreational, and many are purely social.  Perhaps the most
   infamous of the social lists was the eccentric <i>bandykin</i>
   distribution; its latter-day progeny, <i>lectroids</i> and
   <i>tanstaafl</i>, still include a number of the oddest and most
   interesting people in hackerdom.

<p>Mailing lists are easy to create and (unlike Usenet) don't tie up a
   significant amount of machine resources (until they get very large,
   at which point they can become interesting torture tests for mail
   software).  Thus, they are often created temporarily by working
   groups, the members of which can then collaborate on a project
   without ever needing to meet face-to-face.  Much of the material in
   this lexicon was criticized and polished on just such a mailing
   list (called `jargon-friends'), which included all the co-authors
   of Steele-1983.

<p><b>mainframe</b> n. <p>
 Term originally referring to the cabinet
   containing the central processor unit or `main frame' of a
   room-filling <b><a href="#Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a></b> batch machine.  After the emergence of
   smaller `minicomputer' designs in the early 1970s, the
   traditional <b><a href="#big%20iron">big iron</a></b> machines were described as `mainframe
   computers' and eventually just as mainframes.  The term carries the
   connotation of a machine designed for batch rather than interactive
   use, though possibly with an interactive timesharing operating
   system retrofitted onto it; it is especially used of machines built
   by IBM, Unisys, and the other great <b><a href="#dinosaur">dinosaur</a></b>s surviving from
   computing's <b><a href="#Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a></b>.

<p>It has been common wisdom among hackers since the late 1980s that
   the mainframe architectural tradition is essentially dead (outside
   of the tiny market for <b><a href="#number-crunching">number-crunching</a></b> supercomputers (see
   <b><a href="#cray">cray</a></b>)), having been swamped by the recent huge advances in IC
   technology and low-cost personal computing.  The wave of failures,
   takeovers, and mergers among traditional mainframe makers in the
   early 1990s bore this out.  The biggest mainframer of all, IBM, was
   compelled to re-invent itself as a huge systems-consulting house. 
   (See <b><a href="#dinosaurs%20mating">dinosaurs mating</a></b> and <b><a href="#killer%20micro">killer micro</a></b>).

<p>However, in yet another instance of the <b><a href="#cycle%20of%20reincarnation">cycle of reincarnation</a></b>,
   the port of Linux to the IBM S/390 architecture in 1999 - assisted
   by IBM - produced a resurgence of interest in mainframe computing
   as a way of providing huge quanitities of easily maintainable,
   reliable virtual Linux servers, saving IBM's mainframe division
   from almost certain extinction.

 A name, appearing in a C++ object file,

   distinguishable in some other way, such as by having different
   parameter types.  Thus, the internal name must have that additional
   information embedded in it, using the limited character set allowed

   void*,int,unsigned int)" as "@memchr$qpxviui".

<p><b>Mars</b> n. <p>
 A legendary tragic failure, the archetypal
   Hacker Dream Gone Wrong.  Mars was the code name for a family of
   PDP-10-compatible computers built by Systems Concepts (now, The SC
   Group): the multi-processor SC-30M, the small uniprocessor SC-25,
   and the never-built superprocessor SC-40.  These machines were
   marvels of engineering design; although not much slower than the
   unique <b><a href="#Foonly">Foonly</a></b> F-1, they were physically smaller and consumed
   less power than the much slower <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3,
   or F-4 machines.  They were also completely compatible with the DEC
   KL10, and ran all KL10 binaries (including the operating system)
   with no modifications at about 2-3 times faster than a KL10.

<p>When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983, Systems Concepts
   should have made a bundle selling their machine into shops with a
   lot of software investment in PDP-10s, and in fact their spring
   1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the
   PDP-10 world.  TOPS-10 was running on the Mars by the summer of
   1984, and TOPS-20 by early fall.  Unfortunately, the hackers
   running Systems Concepts were much better at designing machines
   than at mass producing or selling them; the company allowed itself
   to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism into continually
   improving the design, and lost credibility as delivery dates
   continued to slip.  They also overpriced the product ridiculously;
   they believed they were competing with the KL10 and VAX 8600 and
   failed to reckon with the likes of Sun Microsystems and other
   hungry startups building workstations with power comparable to the
   KL10 at a fraction of the price.  By the time SC shipped the first
   SC-30M to Stanford in late 1985, most customers had already made
   the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP-10, usually for VMS or
   Unix boxes.  Most of the Mars computers built ended up being
   purchased by CompuServe.

<p>This tale and the related saga of <b><a href="#Foonly">Foonly</a></b> hold a lesson for
   hackers: if you want to play in the <b><a href="#Real%20World">Real World</a></b>, you need to

 [coined by analogy with `gene', by
   Richard Dawkins] An idea considered as a <b><a href="#replicator">replicator</a></b>, esp. 
   with the connotation that memes parasitize people into propagating
   them much as viruses do.  Used esp. in the phrase `meme
   complex' denoting a group of mutually supporting memes that form an
   organized belief system, such as a religion.  This lexicon is an
   (epidemiological) vector of the `hacker subculture' meme complex;
   each entry might be considered a meme.  However, `meme' is often
   misused to mean `meme complex'.  Use of the term connotes
   acceptance of the idea that in humans (and presumably other tool-
   and language-using sophonts) cultural evolution by selection of
   adaptive ideas has superseded biological evolution by selection of
   hereditary traits.  Hackers find this idea congenial for tolerably
   obvious reasons.

 An error in a program's dynamic-store

   Also (esp. at CMU) called <b><a href="#core%20leak">core leak</a></b>.  These problems were
   severe on older machines with small, fixed-size address spaces, and
   special "leak detection" tools were commonly written to root them

   to be sloppy about wasting a bit of memory (although when you run
   out of memory on a VM machine, it means you've got a <em>real</em>

   <b><a href="#alt%20bit">alt bit</a></b>, or (rarely) <b><a href="#hobbit">hobbit</a></b>.  Some terminals and consoles

<p><b>metasyntactic variable</b> n. <p>
 A name used in examples and
   understood to stand for whatever thing is under discussion, or any
   random member of a class of things under discussion.  The word
   <b><a href="#foo">foo</a></b> is the <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b> example.  To avoid confusion,
   hackers never (well, hardly ever) use `foo' or other words like
   it as permanent names for anything.  In filenames, a common
   convention is that any filename beginning with a
   metasyntactic-variable name is a <b><a href="#scratch">scratch</a></b> file that may be
   deleted at any time.

<p>Metasyntactic variables are so called because (1) they are
   variables in the metalanguage used to talk about programs etc; (2)
   they are variables whose values are often variables (as in usages
   like "the value of f(foo,bar) is the sum of foo and bar"). 
   However, it has been plausibly suggested that the real reason for
   the term "metasyntactic variable" is that it sounds good.

<p>To some extent, the list of one's preferred metasyntactic variables
   is a cultural signature.  They occur both in series (used for
   related groups of variables or objects) and as singletons.  Here
   are a few common signatures:

<blockquote>

<p><b>MFTL</b> /M-F-T-L/ <p>
 [abbreviation: `My Favorite Toy Language']
   1. adj.  Describes a talk on a programming language design that
   is heavy on the syntax (with lots of BNF), sometimes even talks
   about semantics (e.g., type systems), but rarely, if ever, has any
   content (see <b><a href="#content-free">content-free</a></b>).  More broadly applied to talks --
   even when the topic is not a programming language -- in which the
   subject matter is gone into in unnecessary and meticulous detail at
   the sacrifice of any conceptual content.  "Well, it was a typical
   MFTL talk".  2. n. Describes a language about which the
   developers are passionate (often to the point of proselytic zeal)
   but no one else cares about.  Applied to the language by those
   outside the originating group.  "He cornered me about type
   resolution in his MFTL."

<p>The first great goal in the mind of the designer of an MFTL is
   usually to write a compiler for it, then bootstrap the design away
   from contamination by lesser languages by writing a compiler for it
   in itself.  Thus, the standard put-down question at an MFTL talk is
   "Has it been used for anything besides its own compiler?"  On the
   other hand, a (compiled) language that cannot even be used to write
   its own compiler is beneath contempt.  (The qualification has
   become necessary because of the increasing popularity of
   interpreted languages like <b><a href="#Perl">Perl</a></b> and <b><a href="#Python">Python</a></b>.) See
   <b><a href="#break-even%20point">break-even point</a></b>.

<p>(On a related note, Doug McIlroy once proposed a test of the
   generality and utility of a language and the operating system under
   which it is compiled: "Is the output of a FORTRAN program
   acceptable as input to the FORTRAN compiler?"  In other words, can
   you write programs that write programs? (See <b><a href="#toolsmith">toolsmith</a></b>.) 
   Alarming numbers of (language, OS) pairs fail this test,
   particularly when the language is FORTRAN; aficionados are quick to
   point out that <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b> (even using FORTRAN) passes it handily. 
   That the test could ever be failed is only surprising to those who
   have had the good fortune to have worked only under modern systems
   which lack OS-supported and -imposed "file types".)

<p><b>micro-</b> pref. <p>
 1. Very small; this is the root of its use as
   a quantifier prefix.  2. A quantifier prefix, calling for
   multiplication by 10^(-6) (see <b><a href="#quantifiers">quantifiers</a></b>). 
   Neither of these uses is peculiar to hackers, but hackers tend to
   fling them both around rather more freely than is countenanced in
   standard English.  It is recorded, for example, that one CS
   professor used to characterize the standard length of his lectures
   as a microcentury -- that is, about 52.6 minutes (see also
   <b><a href="#attoparsec">attoparsec</a></b>, <b><a href="#nanoacre">nanoacre</a></b>, and especially
   <b><a href="#microfortnight">microfortnight</a></b>).  3. Personal or human-scale -- that is,
   capable of being maintained or comprehended or manipulated by one
   human being.  This sense is generalized from `microcomputer',
   and is esp. used in contrast with `macro-' (the corresponding
   Greek prefix meaning `large').  4. Local as opposed to global (or
   <b><a href="#macro-">macro-</a></b>).  Thus a hacker might say that buying a smaller car to
   reduce pollution only solves a microproblem; the macroproblem of
   getting to work might be better solved by using mass transit,
   moving to within walking distance, or (best of all) telecommuting.

 The unit of <b><a href="#bogosity">bogosity</a></b>. 
   Consensus is that this is the largest unit practical for everyday
   use.  The microLenat, originally invented by David Jefferson, was
   promulgated as an attack against noted computer scientist Doug
   Lenat by a <b><a href="#tenured%20graduate%20student">tenured graduate student</a></b> at CMU.  Doug had failed
   the student on an important exam because the student gave only "AI
   is bogus" as his answer to the questions.  The slur is generally
   considered unmerited, but it has become a running gag nevertheless. 
   Some of Doug's friends argue that <em>of course</em> a microLenat is
   bogus, since it is only one millionth of a Lenat.  Others have
   suggested that the unit should be redesignated after the grad
   student, as the microReid.

 A unit of talking speed,

   eponymous Butler Lampson (a CS theorist and systems implementor
   highly regarded among hackers) goes at 1000.  A few people speak
   faster.  This unit is sometimes used to compare the (sometimes
   widely disparate) rates at which people can generate ideas and
   actually emit them in speech.  For example, noted computer
   architect C. Gordon Bell (designer of the PDP-11) is said, with
   some awe, to think at about 1200 mL but only talk at about 300; he
   is frequently reduced to fragments of sentences as his mouth tries

<p><b>misfeature</b> /mis-fee'chr/ or /mis'fee`chr/ n. <p>

<p>[common] A feature that eventually causes lossage, possibly because
   it is not adequate for a new situation that has evolved.  Since it
   results from a deliberate and properly implemented feature, a
   misfeature is not a bug.  Nor is it a simple unforeseen side
   effect; the term implies that the feature in question was carefully
   planned, but its long-term consequences were not accurately or
   adequately predicted (which is quite different from not having
   thought ahead at all).  A misfeature can be a particularly stubborn
   problem to resolve, because fixing it usually involves a
   substantial philosophical change to the structure of the system
   involved.

<p>Many misfeatures (especially in user-interface design) arise
   because the designers/implementors mistake their personal tastes
   for laws of nature.  Often a former feature becomes a misfeature
   because trade-offs were made whose parameters subsequently change
   (possibly only in the judgment of the implementors).  "Well, yeah,
   it is kind of a misfeature that file names are limited to six
   characters, but the original implementors wanted to save directory
   space and we're stuck with it for now."

   3): double sixes are both bignums and moby sixes, but moby ones are
   not bignums (the use of `moby' to describe double ones is
   sarcastic).  Standard emphatic forms: `Moby foo', `moby win',
   `moby loss'.  `Foby moo': a spoonerism due to Richard
   Greenblatt.  5. The largest available unit of something which is
   available in discrete increments.  Thus, ordering a "moby Coke"
   at the local fast-food joint is not just a request for a large
   Coke, it's an explicit request for the largest size they sell.

<p>This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to
   the MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge
   when it was installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical
   memory size for a timesharing system was 72 kilobytes).  Thus, a
   moby is classically 256K 36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or
   PDP-10 moby.  Back when address registers were narrow the term was
   more generally useful, because when a computer had virtual memory
   mapping, it might actually have more physical memory attached to it
   than any one program could access directly.  One could then say
   "This computer has 6 mobies" meaning that the ratio of physical
   memory to address space is 6, without having to say specifically
   how much memory there actually is.  That in turn implied that the
   computer could timeshare six `full-sized' programs without having
   to swap programs between memory and disk.

<p>Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces
   are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto
   a machine, so most systems have much <em>less</em> than one
   theoretical `native' moby of <b><a href="#core">core</a></b>.  Also, more modern
   memory-management techniques (esp. paging) make the `moby
   count' less significant.  However, there is one series of
   widely-used chips for which the term could stand to be revived --
   the Intel 8088 and 80286 with their incredibly <b><a href="#brain-damaged">brain-damaged</a></b>
   segmented-memory designs.  On these, a `moby' would be the
   1-megabyte address span of a segment/offset pair (by coincidence, a
   PDP-10 moby was exactly 1 megabyte of 9-bit bytes).

<p><b>mode</b> n. <p>
 [common] A general state, usually used with an
   adjective describing the state.  Use of the word `mode' rather
   than `state' implies that the state is extended over time, and
   probably also that some activity characteristic of that state is
   being carried out. "No time to hack; I'm in thesis mode."  In its
   jargon sense, `mode' is most often attributed to people, though
   it is sometimes applied to programs and inanimate objects. In
   particular, see <b><a href="#hack%20mode">hack mode</a></b>, <b><a href="#day%20mode">day mode</a></b>, <b><a href="#night%20mode">night mode</a></b>,

   <b><a href="#talk%20mode">talk mode</a></b>.

<p>One also often hears the verbs `enable' and `disable' used in
   connection with jargon modes.  Thus, for example, a sillier way of
   saying "I'm going to crash" is "I'm going to enable crash mode
   now".  One might also hear a request to "disable flame mode,
   please".

<p>In a usage much closer to techspeak, a mode is a special state that
   certain user interfaces must pass into in order to perform certain
   functions.  For example, in order to insert characters into a
   document in the Unix editor <code>vi</code>, one must type the "i" key,
   which invokes the "Insert" command.  The effect of this command
   is to put vi into "insert mode", in which typing the "i" key
   has a quite different effect (to wit, it inserts an "i" into the
   document).  One must then hit another special key, "ESC", in
   order to leave "insert mode".  Nowadays, modeful interfaces are
   generally considered <b><a href="#losing">losing</a></b> but survive in quite a few widely
   used tools built in less enlightened times.

<p><b>Moore's Law</b> /morz law/ prov. <p>
 The observation that the
   logic density of silicon integrated circuits has closely followed
   the curve (bits per square inch)  = 2^(t - 1962) where t
   is time in years; that is, the amount of information storable on a
   given amount of silicon has roughly doubled every year since the
   technology was invented.  This relation, first uttered in 1964 by
   semiconductor engineer Gordon Moore (who co-founded Intel four
   years later) held until the late 1970s, at which point the doubling
   period slowed to 18 months.  The doubling period remained at that
   value through time of writing (late 1999).  Moore's Law is
   apparently self-fulfilling. The implication is that somebody,
   somewhere is going to be able to build a better chip than you if
   you rest on your laurels, so you'd better start pushing hard on the
   problem. See also <b><a href="#Parkinson's%20Law%20of%20Data">Parkinson's Law of Data</a></b> and <b><a href="#Gates's%20Law">Gates's Law</a></b>.

   Numerous features, including vaguely Unix-like but rather broken

<p><b>mu</b> /moo/ <p>
 The correct answer to the classic trick question
   "Have you stopped beating your wife yet?".  Assuming that you
   have no wife or you have never beaten your wife, the answer "yes"
   is wrong because it implies that you used to beat your wife and
   then stopped, but "no" is worse because it suggests that you have
   one and are still beating her.  According to various Discordians
   and Douglas Hofstadter the correct answer is usually "mu", a
   Japanese word alleged to mean "Your question cannot be answered
   because it depends on incorrect assumptions".  Hackers tend to be
   sensitive to logical inadequacies in language, and many have
   adopted this suggestion with enthusiasm.  The word `mu' is
   actually from Chinese, meaning `nothing'; it is used in
   mainstream Japanese in that sense.  Native speakers do not
   recognize the Discordian question-denying use, which almost certainly
   derives from overgeneralization of the answer in the following
   well-known Rinzai Zen <b><a href="#koan">koan</a></b>:

   University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants of
   that game still exist today and are sometimes generically called
   <i>BartleMUD</i>s.  There is a widespread myth (repeated,
   unfortunately, by earlier versions of this lexicon) that the name
   MUD was trademarked to the commercial MUD run by Bartle on British
   Telecom (the motto: "You haven't <em>lived</em> 'til you've
   <em>died</em> on MUD!"); however, this is false -- Richard Bartle
   explicitly placed `MUD' in the public domain in 1985.  BT was upset
   at this, as they had already printed trademark claims on some maps
   and posters, which were released and created the myth.

<p>Students on the European academic networks quickly improved on the
   MUD concept, spawning several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD). 
   Many of these had associated bulletin-board systems for social
   interaction.  Because these had an image as `research' they
   often survived administrative hostility to BBSs in general.  This,
   together with the fact that Usenet feeds were often spotty and
   difficult to get in the U.K., made the MUDs major foci of hackish
   social interaction there.

<p>AberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and
   quickly gained popularity in the U.S.; they became nuclei for large
   hacker communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom
   (some observers see parallels with the growth of Usenet in the
   early 1980s).  The second wave of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants)
   tended to emphasize social interaction, puzzles, and cooperative
   world-building as opposed to combat and competition (in writing,
   these social MUDs are sometimes referred to as `MU*', with `MUD'
   implicitly reserved for the more game-oriented ones).  By 1991,
   over 50% of MUD sites were of a third major variety, LPMUD, which
   synthesizes the combat/puzzle aspects of AberMUD and older systems
   with the extensibility of TinyMud.  In 1996 the cutting edge of the
   technology is Pavel Curtis's MOO, even more extensible using a
   built-in object-oriented language.  The trend toward greater
   programmability and flexibility will doubtless continue.

<p>The state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly,
   with new simulation designs appearing (seemingly) every month. 
   Around 1991 there was an unsuccessful movement to deprecate the
   term <b><a href="#MUD">MUD</a></b> itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding variety
   of names corresponding to the different simulation styles being
   explored.  It survived.  See also <b><a href="#bonk%2foif">bonk/oif</a></b>, <b><a href="#FOD">FOD</a></b>,

<p><b>mudhead</b> n. <p>
 Commonly used to refer to a <b><a href="#MUD">MUD</a></b> player who
   eats, sleeps, and breathes MUD.  Mudheads have been known to fail
   their degrees, drop out, etc., with the consolation, however, that
   they made wizard level.  When encountered in person, on a MUD, or
   in a chat system, all a mudhead will talk about is three topics:
   the tactic, character, or wizard that is supposedly always unfairly
   stopping him/her from becoming a wizard or beating a favorite MUD;
   why the specific game he/she has experience with is so much better
   than any other; and the MUD he or she is writing or going to write
   because his/her design ideas are so much better than in any
   existing MUD.  See also <b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b>.

<p>To the anthropologically literate, this term may recall the
   Zuni/Hopi legend of the mudheads or `koyemshi', mythical
   half-formed children of an unnatural union.  Figures representing
   them act as clowns in Zuni sacred ceremonies.  Others may recall
   the `High School Madness' sequence from the Firesign Theatre album
   "Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers", in which there
   is a character named "Mudhead".

<p><b>muggle</b> <p>
 [from J.K. Rowling's `Harry Potter' books, 1998] A
   non-<b><a href="#wizard">wizard</a></b>.  Not as disparaging as <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b>; implies vague
   pity rather than contempt.  In the universe of Rowling's enormously
   (and deservedly) popular children's series, muggles and wizards
   inhabit the same modern world, but each group is ignorant of the
   commonplaces of the others' existence - most muggles are unaware
   that wizards exist, and wizards (used to magical ways of doing
   everything) are perplexed and fascinated by muggle artifacts.

<p><b>Multics</b> /muhl'tiks/ n. <p>
 [from "MULTiplexed
   Information and Computing Service"] An early time-sharing
   <b><a href="#operating%20system">operating system</a></b> co-designed by a consortium including MIT,
   GE, and Bell Laboratories as a successor to <b><a href="#CTSS">CTSS</a></b>.  The design
   was first presented in 1965, planned for operation in 1967,
   first operational in 1969, and took several more years to achieve
   respectable performance and stability.

<p>Multics was very innovative for its time -- among other things, it
   provided a hierarchical file system with access control on
   individual files and introduced the idea of treating all devices
   uniformly as special files.  It was also the first OS to run on a
   symmetric multiprocessor, and the only general-purpose system to be
   awarded a B2 security rating by the NSA (see <b><a href="#Orange%20Book">Orange Book</a></b>).

<p>Bell Labs left the development effort in 1969 after judging that
   <b><a href="#second-system%20effect">second-system effect</a></b> had bloated Multics to the point of
   practical unusability.  Honeywell commercialized Multics in
   1972 after buying out GE's computer group, but it was never very
   successful: at its peak in the 1980s, there were between 75 and 100
   Multics sites, each a multi-million dollar mainframe.

<p>One of the former Multics developers from Bell Labs was Ken
   Thompson, and <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b> deliberately carried through and extended
   many of Multics' design ideas; indeed, Thompson described the very
   name `Unix' as `a weak pun on Multics'.  For this and other
   reasons, aspects of the Multics design remain a topic of occasional
   debate among hackers.  See also <b><a href="#brain-damaged">brain-damaged</a></b> and
   <b><a href="#GCOS">GCOS</a></b>.

<p>MIT ended its development association with Multics in 1977. 
   Honeywell sold its computer business to Bull in the mid 80s, and
   development on Multics was stopped in 1988.  Four Multics sites
   were known to be still in use as late as 1998, but the last one (a
   Canadian military site) was decomissioned in November 2000.  There
   is a Multics page at

<p><b>mumble</b> interj. <p>
 1. Said when the correct response is too
   complicated to enunciate, or the speaker has not thought it out. 
   Often prefaces a longer answer, or indicates a general reluctance
   to get into a long discussion.  "Don't you think that we could
   improve LISP performance by using a hybrid reference-count
   transaction garbage collector, if the cache is big enough and there
   are some extra cache bits for the microcode to use?"  "Well,
   mumble <small>...</small> I'll have to think about it."  2. [MIT] Expression
   of not-quite-articulated agreement, often used as an informal vote
   of consensus in a meeting: "So, shall we dike out the COBOL
   emulation?"  "Mumble!"  3. Sometimes used as an expression of
   disagreement (distinguished from sense 2 by tone of voice and other
   cues).  "I think we should buy a <b><a href="#VAX">VAX</a></b>."  "Mumble!"  Common
   variant: `mumble frotz' (see <b><a href="#frotz">frotz</a></b>; interestingly, one does
   not say `mumble frobnitz' even though `frotz' is short for
   `frobnitz').  4. Yet another <b><a href="#metasyntactic%20variable">metasyntactic variable</a></b>, like
   <b><a href="#foo">foo</a></b>.  5. When used as a question ("Mumble?") means "I

   on-line as a placefiller for things one is barred from giving
   details about.  For example, a poster with pre-released hardware in
   his machine might say "Yup, my machine now has an extra 16M of
   memory, thanks to the card I'm testing for Mumbleco." 7. A

<p><b>munching squares</b> n. <p>
 A <b><a href="#display%20hack">display hack</a></b> dating back to the
   PDP-1 (ca. 1962, reportedly discovered by Jackson Wright), which
   employs a trivial computation (repeatedly plotting the graph Y = X
   XOR T for successive values of T -- see <b><a href="#HAKMEM">HAKMEM</a></b> items
   146-148) to produce an impressive display of moving and growing
   squares that devour the screen.  The initial value of T is treated
   as a parameter, which, when well-chosen, can produce amazing
   effects.  Some of these, later (re)discovered on the LISP machine,
   have been christened `munching triangles' (try AND for XOR and
   toggling points instead of plotting them), `munching w's', and
   `munching mazes'.  More generally, suppose a graphics program
   produces an impressive and ever-changing display of some basic
   form, foo, on a display terminal, and does it using a relatively
   simple program; then the program (or the resulting display) is
   likely to be referred to as `munching foos'.  [This is a good

<p><b>Murphy's Law</b> prov. <p>
 The correct, <em>original</em> Murphy's
   Law reads: "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one
   of those ways can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do
   it."  This is a principle of defensive design, cited here because
   it is usually given in mutant forms less descriptive of the
   challenges of design for <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b>s.  For example, you don't make a
   two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it `THIS WAY UP'; if it
   matters which way it is plugged in, then you make the design
   asymmetrical (see also the anecdote under <b><a href="#magic%20smoke">magic smoke</a></b>).

<p>Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of the engineers on the rocket-sled
   experiments that were done by the U.S. Air Force in 1949 to test
   human acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981).  One experiment
   involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of
   the subject's body.  There were two ways each sensor could be glued
   to its mount, and somebody methodically installed all 16 the wrong
   way around.  Murphy then made the original form of his
   pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John Paul Stapp)
   quoted at a news conference a few days later.

<p>Within months `Murphy's Law' had spread to various technical
   cultures connected to aerospace engineering.  Before too many years
   had gone by variants had passed into the popular imagination,
   changing as they went.  Most of these are variants on "Anything
   that can go wrong, will"; this is correctly referred to as
   <b><a href="#Finagle's%20Law">Finagle's Law</a></b>.  The memetic drift apparent in these mutants
   clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!

<p><b>music</b> n. <p>
 A common extracurricular interest of hackers

   <b><a href="#filk">filk</a></b>).  Hackish folklore has long claimed that musical and
   programming abilities are closely related, and there has been at
   least one large-scale statistical study that supports this. 
   Hackers, as a rule, like music and often develop musical
   appreciation in unusual and interesting directions.  Folk music is
   very big in hacker circles; so is electronic music, and the sort of
   elaborate instrumental jazz/rock that used to be called
   `progressive' and isn't recorded much any more.  The hacker's
   musical range tends to be wide; many can listen with equal
   appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes, Gentle Giant, Pat
   Metheny, Scott Joplin, Tangerine Dream, Dream Theater, King Sunny
   Ade, The Pretenders, Screaming Trees, or the Brandenburg Concerti. 
   It is also apparently true that hackerdom includes a much higher
   concentration of talented amateur musicians than one would expect
   from a similar-sized control group of <b><a href="#mundane">mundane</a></b> types.

<p><b>N</b> /N/ quant. <p>
 1. A large and indeterminate number of
   objects: "There were N bugs in that crock!"  Also used in
   its original sense of a variable name: "This crock has N
   bugs, as N goes to infinity."  (The true number of bugs is
   always at least N + 1; see <b><a href="#Lubarsky's%20Law%20of%20Cybernetic%20Entomology">Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic Entomology</a></b>.)  2. A variable whose value is inherited from the
   current context.  For example, when a meal is being ordered at a
   restaurant, N may be understood to mean however many people
   there are at the table.  From the remark "We'd like to order
   N wonton soups and a family dinner for N - 1" you
   can deduce that one person at the table wants to eat only soup,
   even though you don't know how many people there are (see
   <b><a href="#great-wall">great-wall</a></b>).  3. `Nth': adj. The ordinal counterpart
   of N, senses 1 and 2.  "Now for the Nth and last
   time<small>...</small>" In the specific context "Nth-year grad
   student", N is generally assumed to be at least 4, and is
   usually 5 or more (see <b><a href="#tenured%20graduate%20student">tenured graduate student</a></b>).  See also

<p><b>nadger</b> /nad'jr/ v. <p>
 [UK, from rude slang noun
   `nadgers' for testicles; compare American &amp; British `bollixed']
   Of software or hardware (not people), to twiddle some object in a
   hidden manner, generally so that it conforms better to some format. 
   For instance, string printing routines on 8-bit processors often
   take the string text from the instruction stream, thus a print call
   looks like <code>jsr print:"Hello world"</code>.  The print routine has
   to `nadger' the saved instruction pointer so that the processor
   doesn't try to execute the text as instructions when the subroutine
   returns.  See <b><a href="#adger">adger</a></b>.

<p><b>naive</b> adj. <p>
 1. Untutored in the perversities of some particular
   program or system; one who still tries to do things in an intuitive
   way, rather than the right way (in really good designs these
   coincide, but most designs aren't `really good' in the
   appropriate sense).  This trait is completely unrelated to general
   maturity or competence, or even competence at any other specific
   program.  It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of
   computing that the natural opposite of this term is often claimed
   to be `experienced user' but is really more like `cynical
   user'.  2. Said of an algorithm that doesn't take advantage of
   some superior but advanced technique, e.g., the <b><a href="#bubble%20sort">bubble sort</a></b>. It
   may imply naivete on the part of the programmer, although there are
   situations where a naive algorithm is preferred, because it is more
   important to keep the code comprehensible than to go for maximum
   performance. "I know the linear search is naive, but in this case the
   list typically only has half a dozen items." Compare <b><a href="#brute%20force">brute force</a></b>.

<p><b>nanotechnology</b> /nan'-oh-tek-no`l*-jee/ n. <p>
 A
   hypothetical fabrication technology in which objects are designed
   and built with the individual specification and placement of each
   separate atom.  The first unequivocal nanofabrication experiments
   took place in 1990, for example with the deposition of individual
   xenon atoms on a nickel substrate to spell the logo of a certain
   very large computer company.  Nanotechnology has been a hot topic
   in the hacker subculture ever since the term was coined by K. Eric
   Drexler in his book "Engines of Creation" (Anchor/Doubleday,
   ISBN 0-385-19973-2), where he predicted that nanotechnology could
   give rise to replicating assemblers, permitting an exponential
   growth of productivity and personal wealth (there's an authorized
   transcription at

 Recognized shorthand on the Usenet group
   <i>comp.std.c</i> for any unexpected behavior of a C compiler on
   encountering an undefined construct.  During a discussion on that
   group in early 1992, a regular remarked "When the compiler
   encounters [a given undefined construct] it is legal for it to make
   demons fly out of your nose" (the implication is that the compiler
   may choose any arbitrarily bizarre way to interpret the code
   without violating the ANSI C standard).  Someone else followed up
   with a reference to "nasal demons", which quickly became
   established.

 The label used to refer to one of
   the continuing <b><a href="#holy%20wars">holy wars</a></b> in AI research.  This conflict
   tangles together two separate issues.  One is the relationship
   between human reasoning and AI; `neats' tend to try to build
   systems that `reason' in some way identifiably similar to the
   way humans report themselves as doing, while `scruffies' profess
   not to care whether an algorithm resembles human reasoning in the
   least as long as it works.  More importantly, neats tend to believe
   that logic is king, while scruffies favor looser, more ad-hoc
   methods driven by empirical knowledge.  To a neat, scruffy methods
   appear promiscuous, successful only by accident, and not productive
   of insights about how intelligence actually works; to a scruffy,
   neat methods appear to be hung up on formalism and irrelevant to
   the hard-to-capture `common sense' of living intelligences.

<p>The word itself appears to derive from the lines "And then, just
   to show them, I'll sail to Ka-Troo / And Bring Back an It-Kutch, a
   Preep and a Proo, / A Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker, too!" in
   the Dr. Seuss book "If I Ran the Zoo" (1950). (The spellings
   `nurd' and `gnurd' also used to be current at MIT, where `nurd' is
   reported from as far back as 1957.) How it developed its mainstream
   meaning is unclear, but sense 1 seems to have entered mass culture
   in the early 1970s (there are reports that in the mid-1960s it
   meant roughly "annoying misfit"
   without the connotation of intelligence).

<p>An IEEE Spectrum article (4/95, page 16) once derived `nerd' in its
   variant form `knurd' from the word `drunk' backwards, but this
   bears all the hallmarks of a bogus folk etymology.

<p>Hackers developed sense 2 in self-defense perhaps ten years later,
   and some actually wear "Nerd Pride" buttons, only half as a
   joke.  At MIT one can find not only buttons but (what else?) pocket
   protectors bearing the slogan and the MIT seal.

 [Cisco] A command in a complex piece of

   almost always implies an <b><a href="#Internet%20address">Internet address</a></b>). Net
   addresses are often used in email text as a more concise substitute
   for personal names; indeed, hackers may come to know each other
   quite well by network names without ever learning each others'
   `legal' monikers.  Indeed, display of a network address (e.g. on
   business cards) used to function as an important hacker
   identification signal, like lodge pins among Masons or tie-dyed
   T-shirts among Grateful Dead fans.  In the day of pervasive
   Internet this is less true, but you can still be fairly sure that
   anyone with a network address handwritten on his or her convention

<p><b>network meltdown</b> n. <p>

   the network equivalent of <b><a href="#thrash">thrash</a></b>ing.  This may be induced by a

<p>Network meltdown is often a result of network designs that are
   optimized for a steady state of moderate load and don't cope well
   with the very jagged, bursty usage patterns of the real world.  One
   amusing instance of this is triggered by the popular and very
   bloody shoot-'em-up game <i>Doom</i> on the PC.  When used in
   multiplayer mode over a network, the game uses broadcast packets to
   inform other machines when bullets are fired.  This causes problems
   with weapons like the chain gun which fire rapidly -- it can blast
   the network into a meltdown state just as easily as it shreds
   opposing monsters.

<p><b>Nightmare File System</b> n. <p>
 Pejorative hackerism for Sun's
   Network File System (NFS).  In any nontrivial network of Suns
   where there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting, when one Sun goes down,
   the others often freeze up.  Some machine tries to access the down
   one, and (getting no response) repeats indefinitely.  This causes
   it to appear dead to some messages (what is actually happening is
   that it is locked up in what should have been a brief excursion to
   a higher <b><a href="#spl">spl</a></b> level).  Then another machine tries to reach
   either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself
   becomes pseudo-down.  The first machine to discover the down one is
   now trying both to access the down one and to respond to the
   pseudo-down one, so it is even harder to reach.  This situation
   snowballs very quickly, and soon the entire network of machines is
   frozen -- worst of all, the user can't even abort the file access
   that started the problem!  Many of NFS's problems are excused by
   partisans as being an inevitable result of its statelessness, which
   is held to be a great feature (critics, of course, call it a great
   <b><a href="#misfeature">misfeature</a></b>).  (ITS partisans are apt to cite this as proof of
   Unix's alleged bogosity; ITS had a working NFS-like shared file
   system with none of these problems in the early 1970s.)  See also

<p><b>NIL</b> /nil/ <p>
 No.  Used in reply to a question, particularly
   one asked using the `-P' convention.  Most hackers assume this
   derives simply from LISP terminology for `false' (see also
   <b><a href="#T">T</a></b>), but NIL as a negative reply was well-established among
   radio hams decades before the advent of LISP.  The historical
   connection between early hackerdom and the ham radio world was
   strong enough that this may have been an influence.

<p><b>Ninety-Ninety Rule</b> n. <p>
 "The first 90% of the code
   accounts for the first 90% of the development time.  The remaining
   10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development
   time."  Attributed to Tom Cargill of Bell Labs, and popularized by
   Jon Bentley's September 1985 "Bumper-Sticker Computer Science"
   column in "Communications of the ACM".  It was there called
   the "Rule of Credibility", a name which seems not to have stuck. 
   Other maxims in the same vein include the law attributed to the
   early British computer scientist Douglas Hartree: "The time from
   now until the completion of the project tends to become constant."

<p><b>nipple mouse</b> n. <p>
 Var. `clit mouse, clitoris' Common
   term for the pointing device used on IBM ThinkPads and a few other
   laptop computers.  The device, which sits between the `g' and `h'
   keys on the keyboard, indeed resembles a rubber nipple intended to
   be tweaked by a forefinger.  Many hackers consider these superior
   to the glide pads found on most laptops, which are harder to
   control precisely.

<p><b>Nominal Semidestructor</b> n. <p>
 Soundalike slang for `National
   Semiconductor', found among other places in the Networking/2
   networking sources.  During the late 1970s to mid-1980s this
   company marketed a series of microprocessors including the NS16000
   and NS32000 and several variants.  At one point early in the great
   microprocessor race, the specs on these chips made them look like
   serious competition for the rising Intel 80x86 and Motorola 680x0
   series.  Unfortunately, the actual parts were notoriously flaky and
   never implemented the full instruction set promised in their
   literature, apparently because the company couldn't get any of the
   mask steppings to work as designed.  They eventually sank without
   trace, joining the Zilog Z8000 and a few even more obscure
   also-rans in the graveyard of forgotten microprocessors.  Compare

 [scientific computation] 1. Behaving in an

   "When you talk to Bob, don't mention the drug problem or he'll go

<p><b>NP-</b> /N-P/ pref. <p>
 Extremely.  Used to modify adjectives
   describing a level or quality of difficulty; the connotation is
   often `more so than it should be'. This is generalized from the
   computer-science terms `NP-hard' and `NP-complete';
   NP-complete problems all seem to be very hard, but so far no one
   has found a proof that they are.  NP is
   the set of Nondeterministic-Polynomial algorithms, those that can
   be completed by a nondeterministic Turing machine in an amount of
   time that is a polynomial function of the size of the input; a
   solution for one NP-complete problem would solve all the others. 
   "Coding a BitBlt implementation to perform correctly in every case
   is NP-annoying."

<p>Note, however, that strictly speaking this usage is misleading;
   there are plenty of easy problems in class NP.  NP-complete
   problems are hard not because they are in class NP, but because
   they are the hardest problems in class NP.

<p><b>NSA line eater</b> n. <p>
 The National Security Agency trawling
   program sometimes assumed to be reading the net for the
   U.S. Government's spooks.  Most hackers used to think it was
   mythical but believed in acting as though existed just in case. 
   Since the mid-1990s it has gradually become known that the
   NSA actually does this, quite illegally, through its Echelon
   program.

<p>The standard countermeasure is to put loaded phrases like `KGB',
   `Uzi', `nuclear materials', `Palestine', `cocaine', and
   `assassination' in their <b><a href="#sig%20block">sig block</a></b>s in a (probably futile)
   attempt to confuse and overload the creature.  The <b><a href="#GNU">GNU</a></b> version
   of <b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b> actually has a command that randomly inserts a bunch
   of insidious anarcho-verbiage into your edited text.

<p>As far back as the 1970s there was a mainstream variant of this
   myth involving a `Trunk Line Monitor', which supposedly used speech
   recognition to extract words from telephone trunks.  This is much
   harder than noticing keywords in email, and most of the people who
   originally propagated it had no idea of then-current technology or
   the storage, signal-processing, or speech recognition needs of such
   a project.  On the basis of mass-storage costs alone it would have
   been cheaper to hire 50 high-school students and just let them
   listen in.

<p>Twenty years and several orders of technological magnitude later,
   however, there are clear indications that the NSA has actually
   deployed such filtering (again, very much against U.S. law).  In
   2000, the FBI wants to get into this act with its `Carnivore'
   surveillance system.

<p><b>Obfuscated C Contest</b> n. <p>
 (in full, the `International
   Obfuscated C Code Contest', or IOCCC) An annual contest run since
   1984 over Usenet by Landon Curt Noll and friends.  The overall
   winner is whoever produces the most unreadable, creative, and
   bizarre (but working) C program; various other prizes are awarded
   at the judges' whim.  C's terse syntax and macro-preprocessor
   facilities give contestants a lot of maneuvering room.  The winning
   programs often manage to be simultaneously (a) funny, (b)
   breathtaking works of art, and (c) horrible examples of how
   <em>not</em> to code in C.

<p>This relatively short and sweet entry might help convey the flavor
   of obfuscated C:

<pre><tt>/*
 * HELLO WORLD program
 * by Jack Applin and Robert Heckendorn, 1985
 * (Note: depends on being able to modify elements of argv[],
 * which is not guaranteed by ANSI and often not possible.)
 */
main(v,c)char**c;{for(v[c++]="Hello, world!\n)";
(!!c)[*c]&amp;&amp;(v--||--c&amp;&amp;execlp(*c,*c,c[!!c]+!!c,!c));
**c=!c)write(!!*c,*c,!!**c);}</tt>
</pre>

<p>Here's another good one:

<p><b>Objectionable-C</b> n. <p>
 Hackish take on "Objective-C", the
   name of an object-oriented dialect of C in competition with the
   better-known C++ (it is used to write native applications on the
   NeXT machine).  Objectionable-C uses a Smalltalk-like syntax, but
   lacks the flexibility of Smalltalk method calls, and (like many
   such efforts) comes frustratingly close to attaining the <b><a href="#Right%20Thing">Right Thing</a></b> without actually doing so.

 Used in an exaggeration of its normal meaning,
   to imply total incomprehensibility.  "The reason for that last
   crash is obscure."  "The <code>find(1)</code> command's syntax is
   obscure!"  The phrase `moderately obscure' implies that
   something could be figured out but probably isn't worth the
   trouble.  The construction `obscure in the extreme' is the
   preferred emphatic form.

<p>This term is much older than computing, and is (uncommon) slang
   elsewhere.  A trolley is the small wheel that trolls, or runs
   against, the heavy wire that carries the current to run a
   streetcar.  It's at the end of the long pole (the trolley pole)
   that reaches from the roof of the streetcar to the overhead line. 
   When the trolley stops making contact with the wire (from passing
   through a switch, going over bumpy track, or whatever), the
   streetcar comes to a halt, (usually) without crashing.  The
   streetcar is then said to be off the trolley, or off the wire. 
   Later on, trolley came to mean the streetcar itself.  Since
   streetcars became common in the 1890s, the term is more than 100
   years old.  Nowadays, trolleys are only seen on historic
   streetcars, since modern streetcars use pantographs to contact the
   wire.

<p><b>ogg</b> /og/ v. <p>
 [CMU] 1. In the multi-player space combat
   game Netrek, to execute kamikaze attacks against enemy ships which
   are carrying armies or occupying strategic positions.  Named during
   a game in which one of the players repeatedly used the tactic while
   playing Orion ship G, showing up in the player list as "Og". 
   This trick has been roundly denounced by those who would return to
   the good old days when the tactic of dogfighting was dominant, but
   as Sun Tzu wrote, "What is of supreme importance in war is to
   attack the enemy's strategy, not his tactics."  However, the
   traditional answer to the newbie question "What does ogg mean?" 
   is just "Pick up some armies and I'll show you."  2. In other
   games, to forcefully attack an opponent with the expectation that
   the resources expended will be renewed faster than the opponent
   will be able to regain his previous advantage.  Taken more
   seriously as a tactic since it has gained a simple name.  3. To do
   anything forcefully, possibly without consideration of the drain on
   future resources.  "I guess I'd better go ogg the problem set
   that's due tomorrow."  "Whoops!  I looked down at the map for a
   sec and almost ogged that oncoming car."

<p><b>-oid</b> suff. <p>
 [from Greek suffix -oid = `in the image
   of'] 1. Used as in mainstream slang English to indicate a poor
   imitation, a counterfeit, or some otherwise slightly bogus
   resemblance.  Hackers will happily use it with all sorts of
   non-Greco/Latin stem words that wouldn't keep company with it in
   mainstream English.  For example, "He's a nerdoid" means that he
   superficially resembles a nerd but can't make the grade; a
   `modemoid' might be a 300-baud box (Real Modems run at 28.8 or
   up); a `computeroid' might be any <b><a href="#bitty%20box">bitty box</a></b>.  The word
   `keyboid' could be used to describe a <b><a href="#chiclet%20keyboard">chiclet keyboard</a></b>, but
   would have to be written; spoken, it would confuse the listener as
   to the speaker's city of origin.  2. More specifically, an
   indicator for `resembling an android' which in the past has been
   confined to science-fiction fans and hackers.  It too has recently
   (in 1991) started to go mainstream (most notably in the term
   `trendoid' for victims of terminal hipness).  This is probably
   traceable to the popularization of the term <b><a href="#droid">droid</a></b> in
   "Star Wars" and its sequels.  (See also <b><a href="#windoid">windoid</a></b>.)

<p>Coinages in both forms have been common in science fiction for at
   least fifty years, and hackers (who are often SF fans) have
   probably been making `-oid' jargon for almost that long
   [though GLS and I can personally confirm only that they were
   already common in the mid-1970s --ESR].

<p><b>on the gripping hand</b> <p>
 In the progression that starts "On the
   one hand..." and continues "On the other hand..." mainstream
   English may add "on the third hand..." even though most people
   don't have three hands.  Among hackers, it is just as likely to be
   "on the gripping hand".  This metaphor supplied the title of
   Larry Niven &amp; Jerry Pournelle's 1993 SF novel "The Gripping Hand"
   which involved a species of hostile aliens with three arms (the
   same species, in fact, referenced in <b><a href="#juggling%20eggs">juggling eggs</a></b>).  As with
   <b><a href="#TANSTAAFL">TANSTAAFL</a></b> and <b><a href="#con">con</a></b>, this usage became one of the naturalized
   imports from SF fandom frequently observed among hackers.

<p><b>one-banana problem</b> n. <p>
 At mainframe shops, where the
   computers have operators for routine administrivia, the programmers
   and hardware people tend to look down on the operators and claim
   that a trained monkey could do their job.  It is frequently
   observed that the incentives that would be offered said monkeys can
   be used as a scale to describe the difficulty of a task.  A
   one-banana problem is simple; hence, "It's only a one-banana job
   at the most; what's taking them so long?"

<p>At IBM, folklore divides the world into one-, two-, and
   three-banana problems.  Other cultures have different hierarchies
   and may divide them more finely; at ICL, for example, five grapes
   (a bunch) equals a banana.  Their upper limit for the in-house
   <b><a href="#sysape">sysape</a></b>s is said to be two bananas and three grapes (another
   source claims it's three bananas and one grape, but observes
   "However, this is subject to local variations, cosmic rays and
   ISO").  At a complication level any higher than that, one asks the
   manufacturers to send someone around to check things.

<p><b>one-liner wars</b> n. <p>
 A game popular among hackers who code in
   the language APL (see <b><a href="#write-only%20language">write-only language</a></b> and <b><a href="#line%20noise">line noise</a></b>).  The objective is to see who can code the most interesting
   and/or useful routine in one line of operators chosen from APL's
   exceedingly <b><a href="#hairy">hairy</a></b> primitive set.  A similar amusement was
   practiced among <b><a href="#TECO">TECO</a></b> hackers and is now popular among
   <b><a href="#Perl">Perl</a></b> aficionados.

<p>Ken Iverson, the inventor of APL, has been credited with a
   one-liner that, given a number N, produces a list of the
   prime numbers from 1 to N inclusive.  It looks like this:

<p>	(2 = 0 +.= T o.| T) / T &lt;- iN

<p>where `o' is the APL null character, the assignment arrow is a
   single character, and `i' represents the APL iota.

<p>Here's a <b><a href="#Perl">Perl</a></b> program that prints primes:

<pre>        perl -wle '(1 x $_) !~ /^(11+)\1+$/ &amp;&amp; print while ++ $_'
</pre>

<p>In the Perl world this game is sometimes called Perl Golf because
   the player with the fewest (key)strokes wins.

<p><b>ooblick</b> /oo'blik/ n. <p>
 [from the Dr. Seuss title
   "Bartholomew and the Oobleck"; the spelling `oobleck' is still
   current in the mainstream] A bizarre semi-liquid sludge made from
   cornstarch and water.  Enjoyed among hackers who make batches
   during playtime at parties for its amusing and extremely
   non-Newtonian behavior; it pours and splatters, but resists rapid
   motion like a solid and will even crack when hit by a hammer. 
   Often found near lasers.

<p>Here is a field-tested ooblick recipe contributed by GLS:

<dl>
<dt>1 cup cornstarch
<dt>1 cup baking soda
<dt>3/4 cup water
<dt>N drops of food coloring
<dd></dl>

<p>This recipe isn't quite as non-Newtonian as a pure cornstarch
   ooblick, but has an appropriately slimy feel.

<p>Some, however, insist that the notion of an ooblick <em>recipe</em>
   is far too mechanical, and that it is best to add the water in
   small increments so that the various mixed states the cornstarch
   goes through as it <em>becomes</em> ooblick can be grokked in
   fullness by many hands.  For optional ingredients of this
   experience, see the "<b><a href="#Ceremonial%20Chemicals">Ceremonial Chemicals</a></b>" section of

<p><b>open source</b> n. <p>
 [common; also adj. `open-source'] Term
   coined in March 1998 following the Mozilla release to describe
   software distributed in source under licenses guaranteeing anybody
   rights to freely use, modify, and redistribute, the code.  The
   intent was to be able to sell the hackers' ways of doing software
   to industry and the mainstream by avoiding the negative
   connotations (to <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>s) of the term "<b><a href="#free%20software">free software</a></b>".

 [techspeak] (Often abbreviated `OS')
   The foundation software of a machine; that which
   schedules tasks, allocates storage, and presents a default

   operating system provides and its general design philosophy exert
   an extremely strong influence on programming style and on the
   technical cultures that grow up around its host machines.  Hacker

<p><b>optimism</b> n. <p>
 What a programmer is full of after fixing the
   last bug and before discovering the <em>next</em> last bug.  Fred
   Brooks's book "The Mythical Man-Month" (See "Brooks's
   Law") contains the following paragraph that describes this
   extremely well:

<blockquote>
All programmers are optimists.  Perhaps this
modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy
endings and fairy godmothers.  Perhaps the hundreds of nitty
frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the
end goal.  Perhaps it is merely that computers are young,
programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists.  But
however the selection process works, the result is indisputable:
"This time it will surely run," or "I just found the last bug.".

<p><b>oriental food</b> n. <p>
 Hackers display an intense tropism
   towards oriental cuisine, especially Chinese, and especially of the
   spicier varieties such as Szechuan and Hunan.  This phenomenon
   (which has also been observed in subcultures that overlap heavily
   with hackerdom, most notably science-fiction fandom) has never been
   satisfactorily explained, but is sufficiently intense that one can
   assume the target of a hackish dinner expedition to be the best
   local Chinese place and be right at least three times out of four.

<p><b>orthogonal</b> adj. <p>
 [from mathematics] Mutually independent;
   well separated; sometimes, irrelevant to.  Used in a generalization
   of its mathematical meaning to describe sets of primitives or
   capabilities that, like a vector basis in geometry, span the entire
   `capability space' of the system and are in some sense
   non-overlapping or mutually independent.  For example, in
   architectures such as the PDP-11 or VAX where all or nearly all
   registers can be used interchangeably in any role with respect to
   any instruction, the register set is said to be orthogonal.  Or, in
   logic, the set of operators `not' and `or' is orthogonal, but
   the set `nand', `or', and `not' is not (because any one of
   these can be expressed in terms of the others).  Also used in
   comments on human discourse: "This may be orthogonal to the
   discussion, but<small>...</small>."

<p><b>OS/2</b> /O S too/ n. <p>
 The anointed successor to MS-DOS
   for Intel 286- and 386-based micros; proof that IBM/Microsoft
   couldn't get it right the second time, either.  Often called
   `Half-an-OS'.  Mentioning it is usually good for a cheap laugh
   among hackers -- the design was so <b><a href="#baroque">baroque</a></b>, and the
   implementation of 1.x so bad, that 3 years after introduction you
   could still count the major <b><a href="#app">app</a></b>s shipping for it on the

   have improved somewhat, and informed hackers rated them superior to
   Microsoft Windows (an endorsement which, however, could easily be
   construed as damning with faint praise).  In the mid-1990s IBM put

 [MIT] The place where you put things when

 1. [techspeak] Term for a frequent consequence
   of data arriving faster than it can be consumed, esp. in serial
   line communications.  For example, at 9600 baud there is almost
   exactly one character per millisecond, so if a <b><a href="#silo">silo</a></b> can hold
   only two characters and the machine takes longer than 2 msec to get
   to service the interrupt, at least one character will be lost. 
   2. Also applied to non-serial-I/O communications.  "I forgot to
   pay my electric bill due to mail overrun."  "Sorry, I got four
   phone calls in 3 minutes last night and lost your message to
   overrun."  When <b><a href="#thrash">thrash</a></b>ing at tasks, the next person to make a

 "Data expands to fill

<p><b>parse</b> [from linguistic terminology] vt. <p>
 1. To determine the
   syntactic structure of a sentence or other utterance (close to the
   standard English meaning).  "That was the one I saw you."  "I
   can't parse that."  2. More generally, to understand or
   comprehend.  "It's very simple; you just kretch the glims and then
   aos the zotz."  "I can't parse that."  3. Of fish, to have to
   remove the bones yourself.  "I object to parsing fish", means "I
   don't want to get a whole fish, but a sliced one is okay".  A
   `parsed fish' has been deboned.  There is some controversy over
   whether `unparsed' should mean `bony', or also mean
   `deboned'.

<p><b>Pascal</b> n. <p>
 An Algol-descended language designed by
   Niklaus Wirth on the CDC 6600 around 1967-68 as an instructional
   tool for elementary programming.  This language, designed primarily
   to keep students from shooting themselves in the foot and thus
   extremely restrictive from a general-purpose-programming point of
   view, was later promoted as a general-purpose tool and, in fact,
   became the ancestor of a large family of languages including
   Modula-2 and <b><a href="#Ada">Ada</a></b> (see also <b><a href="#bondage-and-discipline%20language">bondage-and-discipline language</a></b>).  The hackish point of view on Pascal was probably best
   summed up by a devastating (and, in its deadpan way, screamingly
   funny) 1981 paper by Brian Kernighan (of <b><a href="#K&amp;R">K&amp;R</a></b> fame) entitled
   "Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language", which
   was turned down by the technical journals but circulated widely via
   photocopies.  It was eventually published in "Comparing and
   Assessing Programming Languages", edited by Alan Feuer and Narain
   Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984).  Part of his discussion is worth
   repeating here, because its criticisms are still apposite to Pascal
   itself after many years of improvement and could also stand as an
   indictment of many other bondage-and-discipline languages.  (The
   entire essay is available at
   <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html">http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html</a>.)  At the end
   of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:

<blockquote>
9. There is no escape

<p>This last point is perhaps the most important.  The language is
inadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape its
limitations.  There are no casts to disable the type-checking when
necessary.  There is no way to replace the defective run-time
environment with a sensible one, unless one controls the compiler
that defines the "standard procedures".  The language is
closed.

<p>People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal
trap.  Because the language is impotent, it must be extended.  But
each group extends Pascal in its own direction, to make it look
like whatever language they really want.  Extensions for separate
compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, string data types, internal
static variables, initialization, octal numbers, bit operators,
etc., all add to the utility of the language for one group but
destroy its portability to others.

<p>I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond
its original target.  In its pure form, Pascal is a toy language,
suitable for teaching but not for real programming. 
</blockquote>

<p>Pascal has since been entirely displaced (mainly by <b><a href="#C">C</a></b>) from the
   niches it had acquired in serious applications and systems
   programming, and from its role as a teaching language by Java.

<p><b>pastie</b> /pay'stee/ n. <p>
 An adhesive-backed label designed to
   be attached to a key on a keyboard to indicate some non-standard
   character which can be accessed through that key.  Pasties are
   likely to be used in APL environments, where almost every key is
   associated with a special character.  A pastie on the R key, for
   example, might remind the user that it is used to generate the
   rho character.  The term properly refers to
   nipple-concealing devices formerly worn by strippers in concession
   to indecent-exposure laws; compare <b><a href="#tits%20on%20a%20keyboard">tits on a keyboard</a></b>.

<p><b>patch</b> <p>
 1. n. A temporary addition to a piece of code,
   usually as a <b><a href="#quick-and-dirty">quick-and-dirty</a></b> remedy to an existing bug or
   misfeature.  A patch may or may not work, and may or may not
   eventually be incorporated permanently into the program. 
   Distinguished from a <b><a href="#diff">diff</a></b> or <b><a href="#mod">mod</a></b> by the fact that a patch
   is generated by more primitive means than the rest of the program;
   the classical examples are instructions modified by using the front
   panel switches, and changes made directly to the binary executable
   of a program originally written in an <b><a href="#HLL">HLL</a></b>.  Compare
   <b><a href="#one-line%20fix">one-line fix</a></b>.  2. vt. To insert a patch into a piece of code. 
   3. [in the Unix world] n. A <b><a href="#diff">diff</a></b> (sense 2).  4. A set of
   modifications to binaries to be applied by a patching program.  IBM
   operating systems often receive updates to the operating system in
   the form of absolute hexadecimal patches.  If you have modified
   your OS, you have to disassemble these back to the source.  The
   patches might later be corrected by other patches on top of them
   (patches were said to "grow scar tissue").  The result was often
   a convoluted <b><a href="#patch%20space">patch space</a></b> and headaches galore.  5. [Unix] the
   <code>patch(1)</code> program, written by Larry Wall, which automatically
   applies a patch (sense 3) to a set of source code.

<p>There is a classic story of a <b><a href="#tiger%20team">tiger team</a></b> penetrating a secure
   military computer that illustrates the danger inherent in binary
   patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can't -- or don't --
   inspect and examine before installing).  They couldn't find any
   <b><a href="#trap%20door">trap door</a></b>s or any way to penetrate security of IBM's OS, so
   they made a site visit to an IBM office (remember, these were
   official military types who were purportedly on official business),
   swiped some IBM stationery, and created a fake patch.  The patch
   was actually the trapdoor they needed.  The patch was distributed
   at about the right time for an IBM patch, had official stationery
   and all accompanying documentation, and was dutifully installed. 
   The installation manager very shortly thereafter learned something
   about proper procedures.

<p><b>patch pumpkin</b> n. <p>
 [Perl hackers] A notional token passed
   around among the members of a project.  Possession of the patch
   pumpkin means one has the exclusive authority to make
   changes on the project's master source tree.  The implicit
   assumption is that `pumpkin holder' status is temporary and
   rotates periodically among senior project members.

<p>This term comes from the Perl development community, but has been
   sighted elsewhere.  It derives from a stuffed-toy pumpkin
   that was passed around at a development shop years ago as
   the access control for a shared backup-tape drive.

 An unused block of bits left in a binary

   jump or call to the patch space).  The near-universal use of
   compilers and interpreters has made this term rare; it is now
   primarily historical outside IBM shops.  See <b><a href="#patch">patch</a></b> (sense 4),

   specified relative to the root directory (as opposed to relative to
   the current directory; the latter is sometimes called a `relative
   path').  This is also called a `pathname'.  3. [Unix and MS-DOS]
   The `search path', an environment variable specifying the

<p><b>pathological</b> adj. <p>
 1. [scientific computation] Used of a
   data set that is grossly atypical of normal expected input, esp. 
   one that exposes a weakness or bug in whatever algorithm one is
   using.  An algorithm that can be broken by pathological inputs may
   still be useful if such inputs are very unlikely to occur in
   practice.  2. When used of test input, implies that it was
   purposefully engineered as a worst case.  The implication in both
   senses is that the data is spectacularly ill-conditioned or that
   someone had to explicitly set out to break the algorithm in order
   to come up with such a crazy example.  3. Also said of an unlikely
   collection of circumstances.  "If the network is down and comes up
   halfway through the execution of that command by root, the system
   may just crash."  "Yes, but that's a pathological case."  Often
   used to dismiss the case from discussion, with the implication that
   the consequences are acceptable, since they will happen so
   infrequently (if at all) that it doesn't seem worth going to the
   extra trouble to handle that case (see sense 1).

<p><b>PDP-10</b> n. <p>
 [Programmed Data Processor model 10] The
   machine that made timesharing real.  It looms large in hacker
   folklore because of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many
   university computing facilities and research labs, including the
   MIT AI Lab, Stanford, and CMU.  Some aspects of the instruction
   set (most notably the bit-field instructions) are still considered
   unsurpassed.  The 10 was eventually eclipsed by the VAX machines
   (descendants of the PDP-11) when <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> recognized that the 10
   and VAX product lines were competing with each other and decided to
   concentrate its software development effort on the more profitable
   VAX.  The machine was finally dropped from DEC's line in 1983,
   following the failure of the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a
   viable new model.  (Some attempts by other companies to market
   clones came to nothing; see <b><a href="#Foonly">Foonly</a></b> and <b><a href="#Mars">Mars</a></b>.)  This event
   spelled the doom of <b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b> and the technical cultures that had
   spawned the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become
   something of a badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to

 The most famous computer that never was. 
   <b><a href="#PDP-10">PDP-10</a></b> computers running the <b><a href="#TOPS-10">TOPS-10</a></b> operating system
   were labeled `DECsystem-10' as a way of differentiating them from

   `DECSYSTEM-20' (the block capitals being the result of a lawsuit
   brought against DEC by Singer, which once made a computer called
   `system-10'), but contrary to popular lore there was never a
   `PDP-20'; the only difference between a 10 and a 20 was the
   operating system and the color of the paint.  Most (but not all)
   machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted `Basil Blue', whereas
   most TOPS-20 machines were painted `Chinese Red' (often mistakenly
   called orange).

<p><b>peek</b> n.,vt. <p>
 (and <b><a href="#poke">poke</a></b>) The commands in most
   microcomputer BASICs for directly accessing memory contents at an
   absolute address; often extended to mean the corresponding
   constructs in any <b><a href="#HLL">HLL</a></b> (peek reads memory, poke modifies it). 
   Much hacking on small, non-MMU micros used to consist of `peek'ing
   around memory, more or less at random, to find the location where
   the system keeps interesting stuff.  Long (and variably accurate)
   lists of such addresses for various computers circulated (see
   <b><a href="#interrupt%20list">interrupt list</a></b>).  The results of `poke's at these
   addresses may be highly useful, mildly amusing, useless but neat,
   or (most likely) total <b><a href="#lossage">lossage</a></b> (see <b><a href="#killer%20poke">killer poke</a></b>).

<p>Since a <b><a href="#real%20operating%20system">real operating system</a></b> provides useful, higher-level
   services for the tasks commonly performed with peeks and pokes on

   diagnostic of the <b><a href="#newbie">newbie</a></b>.  (Of course, OS kernels often have to

<p><b>pencil and paper</b> n. <p>
 An archaic information storage and
   transmission device that works by depositing smears of graphite on
   bleached wood pulp.  More recent developments in paper-based
   technology include improved `write-once' update devices which use
   tiny rolling heads similar to mouse balls to deposit colored
   pigment.  All these devices require an operator skilled at
   so-called `handwriting' technique.  These technologies are
   ubiquitous outside hackerdom, but nearly forgotten inside it.  Most
   hackers had terrible handwriting to begin with, and years of
   keyboarding tend to have encouraged it to degrade further.  Perhaps
   for this reason, hackers deprecate pencil-and-paper technology and
   often resist using it in any but the most trivial contexts.

<p><b>Pentium</b> n. <p>
 The name given to Intel's P5 chip, the
   successor to the 80486. The name was chosen because of difficulties
   Intel had in trademarking a number. It suggests the number five
   (implying 586) while (according to Intel) conveying a meaning of
   strength "like titanium".  Among hackers, the plural is
   frequently `pentia'. See also <b><a href="#Pentagram%20Pro">Pentagram Pro</a></b>.

<p>Intel did not stick to this convention when naming its P6 processor
   the Pentium Pro; many believe this is due to difficulties in
   selling a chip with "hex" or "sex" in its name.  Successor
   chips have been called `Pentium II', `Pentium III', and
   `Pentium IV'.

<p><b>phase</b> <p>
 1. n. The offset of one's waking-sleeping schedule
   with respect to the standard 24-hour cycle; a useful concept among
   people who often work at night and/or according to no fixed
   schedule.  It is not uncommon to change one's phase by as much as 6
   hours per day on a regular basis.  "What's your phase?"  "I've
   been getting in about 8 <small>P.M.</small> lately, but I'm going to <b><a href="#wrap%20around">wrap around</a></b> to the day schedule by Friday."  A person who is roughly
   12 hours out of phase is sometimes said to be in `night mode'. 
   (The term `day mode' is also (but less frequently) used, meaning
   you're working 9 to 5 (or, more likely, 10 to 6).)  The act of
   altering one's cycle is called `changing phase'; `phase
   shifting' has also been recently reported from Caltech. 
   2. `change phase the hard way': To stay awake for a very long
   time in order to get into a different phase.  3. `change phase
   the easy way': To stay asleep, etc.  However, some claim that
   either staying awake longer or sleeping longer is easy, and that it
   is <em>shortening</em> your day or night that is really hard (see
   <b><a href="#wrap%20around">wrap around</a></b>).  The `jet lag' that afflicts travelers who
   cross many time-zone boundaries may be attributed to two distinct
   causes: the strain of travel per se, and the strain of changing
   phase.  Hackers who suddenly find that they must change phase
   drastically in a short period of time, particularly the hard way,
   experience something very like jet lag without traveling.

   also <b><a href="#heisenbug">heisenbug</a></b>.

<p>True story: Once upon a time there was a program bug that
   really did depend on the phase of the moon.  There was a little
   subroutine that had traditionally been used in various programs at
   MIT to calculate an approximation to the moon's true phase.  GLS
   incorporated this routine into a LISP program that, when it wrote
   out a file, would print a timestamp line almost 80 characters long. 
   Very occasionally the first line of the message would be too long
   and would overflow onto the next line, and when the file was later
   read back in the program would <b><a href="#barf">barf</a></b>.  The length of the first
   line depended on both the precise date and time and the length of
   the phase specification when the timestamp was printed, and so the
   bug literally depended on the phase of the moon!

<p>The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included
   an example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug,
   but the typesetter `corrected' it.  This has since been
   described as the phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.

<p>However, beware of assumptions.  A few years ago, engineers of CERN
   (European Center for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors
   in experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator.  As the
   formidable amount of data generated by such devices is heavily
   processed by computers before being seen by humans, many people
   suggested the software was somehow sensitive to the phase of the
   moon.  A few desperate engineers discovered the truth; the error
   turned out to be the result of a tiny change in the geometry of the
   27km circumference ring, physically caused by the deformation of
   the Earth by the passage of the Moon!  This story has entered
   physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle physics and
   as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest physical
   laws to the most modern science.

<p><b>phreaking</b> /freek'ing/ n. <p>
 [from `phone phreak'] 1. The
   art and science of <b><a href="#cracking">cracking</a></b> the phone network (so as, for
   example, to make free long-distance calls).  2. By extension,
   security-cracking in any other context (especially, but not
   exclusively, on communications networks) (see <b><a href="#cracking">cracking</a></b>).

<p>At one time phreaking was a semi-respectable activity among
   hackers; there was a gentleman's agreement that phreaking as an
   intellectual game and a form of exploration was OK, but serious
   theft of services was taboo.  There was significant crossover
   between the hacker community and the hard-core phone phreaks who
   ran semi-underground networks of their own through such media as
   the legendary "TAP Newsletter".  This ethos began to break
   down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of the techniques put
   them in the hands of less responsible phreaks.  Around the same
   time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical
   ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came
   to depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card
   numbers.  The crimes and punishments of gangs like the `414 group'
   turned that game very ugly.  A few old-time hackers still phreak
   casually just to keep their hand in, but most these days have
   hardly even heard of `blue boxes' or any of the other
   paraphernalia of the great phreaks of yore.

<p><b>ping</b> <p>
 [from the submariners' term for a sonar pulse] 1. n. 
   Slang term for a small network message (ICMP ECHO) sent by a
   computer to check for the presence and alertness of another.  The
   Unix command <code>ping(8)</code> can be used to do this manually (note
   that <code>ping(8)</code>'s author denies the widespread folk etymology
   that the name was ever intended as an acronym for `Packet INternet
   Groper').  Occasionally used as a phone greeting.  See <b><a href="#ACK">ACK</a></b>,
   also <b><a href="#ENQ">ENQ</a></b>.  2. vt. To verify the presence of.  3. vt. To get
   the attention of.  4. vt. To send a message to all members of a
   <b><a href="#mailing%20list">mailing list</a></b> requesting an <b><a href="#ACK">ACK</a></b> (in order to verify that
   everybody's addresses are reachable).  "We haven't heard much of
   anything from Geoff, but he did respond with an ACK both times I
   pinged jargon-friends."  5. n. A quantum packet of happiness. 
   People who are very happy tend to exude pings; furthermore, one can
   intentionally create pings and aim them at a needy party (e.g., a
   depressed person).  This sense of ping may appear as an
   exclamation; "Ping!" (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum of
   happiness; I have been struck by a quantum of happiness).  The form
   "pingfulness", which is used to describe people who exude pings,
   also occurs.  (In the standard abuse of language, "pingfulness"
   can also be used as an exclamation, in which case it's a much
   stronger exclamation than just "ping"!).  Oppose <b><a href="#blargh">blargh</a></b>.

<p>The funniest use of `ping' to date was described in January 1991 by
   Steve Hayman on the Usenet group <i>comp.sys.next</i>.  He was trying
   to isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to
   a NeXT machine, and got tired of having to run back to his console
   after each cabling tweak to see if the ping packets were getting
   through.  So he used the sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then
   wrote a script that repeatedly invoked <code>ping(8)</code>, listened for
   an echo, and played back the recording on each returned packet. 
   Result?  A program that caused the machine to repeat, over and
   over, "Ping <small>...</small> ping <small>...</small> ping <small>...</small>" as long as the
   network was up.  He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through
   the building with one ear cocked, and found a faulty tee connector
   in no time.

<p><b>Ping O' Death</b> n. <p>
 A notorious <b><a href="#exploit">exploit</a></b> that (when
   first discovered) could be easily used to crash a wide variety of
   machines by overunning size limits in their TCP/IP stacks.  First
   revealed in late 1996.  The open-source Unix community patched its
   systems to remove the vulnerability within days or weeks, the
   closed-source OS vendors generally took months.  While the
   difference in response times repeated a pattern familiar from other
   security incidents, the accompanying glare of Web-fueled publicity
   proved unusually embarrassing to the OS vendors and so passed into
   history and myth.  The term is now used to refer to any nudge
   delivered by network wizards over the network that causes bad
   things to happen on the system being nudged.  For the full story on

   scratches in a platinum-iridium bar kept in that same vault --
   this replaced an earlier definition as 10^(-7) times the
   distance between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian

 A Page Description Language (<b><a href="#PDL">PDL</a></b>),
   based on work originally done by John Gaffney at Evans and
   Sutherland in 1976, evolving through `JaM' (`John and Martin',
   Martin Newell) at <b><a href="#XEROX%20PARC">XEROX PARC</a></b>, and finally implemented in its
   current form by John Warnock et al. after he and Chuck Geschke
   founded Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1982.  PostScript gets its
   leverage by using a full programming language, rather than a series
   of low-level escape sequences, to describe an image to be printed
   on a laser printer or other output device (in this it parallels
   <b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b>, which exploited a similar insight about editing tasks). 
   It is also noteworthy for implementing on-the fly rasterization,
   from Bezier curve descriptions, of high-quality fonts at low (e.g. 
   300 dpi) resolution (it was formerly believed that hand-tuned
   bitmap fonts were required for this task).  Hackers consider
   PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all time, and the
   combination of technical merits and widespread availability has
   made PostScript the language of choice for graphical output.

   but the idea is similar.  3.[techspeak] A subset of a standard used
   for a particular purpose.  This sense confuses hackers who wander

<p><b>proprietary</b> adj. <p>
 1. In <b><a href="#marketroid">marketroid</a></b>-speak, superior;
   implies a product imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched
   brilliance of the company's own hardware or software designers. 
   2. In the language of hackers and users, inferior; implies a
   product not conforming to open-systems standards, and thus one that
   puts the customer at the mercy of a vendor able to gouge freely on
   service and upgrade charges after the initial sale has locked the
   customer in.  Often used in the phrase "proprietary crap". 
   3. Synonym for closed-source, e.g. software issued in binary
   without source and under a restrictive license.

<p>Since the coining of the term <b><a href="#open%20source">open source</a></b>, many hackers
   have made a conscious effort to distinguish between
   `proprietary' and `commercial' software.  It is possible
   for software to be commercial (that is, intended to make a profit
   for the producers) without being proprietary.  The reverse is
   also possible, for example in binary-only freeware.

   It is used instead to describe any set of rules that allow

   about the proper form for addressing packets on a network or the

<p><b>pseudoprime</b> n. <p>
 A backgammon prime (six consecutive

   pun derived from number theory: a number that passes a certain kind
   of "primality test" may be called a `pseudoprime' (all primes
   pass any such test, but so do some composite numbers), and any
   number that passes several is, in some sense, almost certainly
   prime. The hacker backgammon usage stems from the idea that a
   pseudoprime is almost as good as a prime: it will do the same job
   unless you are unlucky.

<p><b>punched card</b> n.obs. <p>
 [techspeak] (alt. `punch card') The
   signature medium of computing's <b><a href="#Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a></b>, now obsolescent
   outside of some IBM shops.  The punched card actually predated
   computers considerably, originating in 1801 as a control device for
   mechanical looms.  The version patented by Hollerith and used with
   mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was a piece
   of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm.  There is a widespread myth
   that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used for that
   era's larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have falsified
   this.

<p>IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married
   the punched card to computers, encoding binary information as
   patterns of small rectangular holes; one character per column,
   80 columns per card.  Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and
   hole shapes were tried at various times.

<p>The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the
   IBM punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards
   distributed with many varieties of computers even today.  See

<p><b>punt</b> v. <p>
 [from the punch line of an old joke referring to
   American football: "Drop back 15 yards and punt!"] 1. To give up,
   typically without any intention of retrying.  "Let's punt the
   movie tonight."  "I was going to hack all night to get this
   feature in, but I decided to punt" may mean that you've decided
   not to stay up all night, and may also mean you're not ever even
   going to put in the feature.  2. More specifically, to give up on
   figuring out what the <b><a href="#Right%20Thing">Right Thing</a></b> is and resort to an
   inefficient hack.  3. A design decision to defer solving a problem,
   typically because one cannot define what is desirable sufficiently
   well to frame an algorithmic solution.  "No way to know what the
   right form to dump the graph in is -- we'll punt that for now." 
   4. To hand a tricky implementation problem off to some other
   section of the design.  "It's too hard to get the compiler to do
   that; let's punt to the runtime system." 5. To knock someone off
   an Internet or chat connection; a `punter' thus, is a person or
   program that does this.

<p><b>quadruple bucky</b> n. obs. <p>
 1. On an MIT <b><a href="#space-cadet%20keyboard">space-cadet keyboard</a></b>, use of all four of the shifting keys (control, meta,
   hyper, and super) while typing a character key.  2. On a Stanford
   or MIT keyboard in <b><a href="#raw%20mode">raw mode</a></b>, use of four shift keys while
   typing a fifth character, where the four shift keys are the control
   and meta keys on <em>both</em> sides of the keyboard.  This was very
   difficult to do!  One accepted technique was to press the
   left-control and left-meta keys with your left hand, the
   right-control and right-meta keys with your right hand, and the
   fifth key with your nose.

<p>Quadruple-bucky combinations were very seldom used in practice,
   because when one invented a new command one usually assigned it to
   some character that was easier to type.  If you want to imply that
   a program has ridiculously many commands or features, you can say
   something like: "Oh, the command that makes it spin the tapes
   while whistling Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is
   quadruple-bucky-cokebottle."  See <b><a href="#double%20bucky">double bucky</a></b>, <b><a href="#bucky%20bits">bucky bits</a></b>, <b><a href="#cokebottle">cokebottle</a></b>.

<p><b>quantifiers</b> <p>
 In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric
   prefixes used in the SI (Syst&egrave;me International) conventions for
   scientific measurement have dual uses.  With units of time or
   things that come in powers of 10, such as money, they retain their
   usual meanings of multiplication by powers of 1000 = 10^3. 
   But when used with bytes or other things that naturally come in
   powers of 2, they usually denote multiplication by powers of
   1024 = 2^(10).

<p>Here are the SI magnifying prefixes, along with the corresponding
   binary interpretations in common use:

<pre>prefix  decimal  binary
kilo-   1000^1   1024^1 = 2^10 = 1,024 <br>
mega-   1000^2   1024^2 = 2^20 = 1,048,576 <br>
giga-   1000^3   1024^3 = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 <br>
tera-   1000^4   1024^4 = 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776 <br>
peta-   1000^5   1024^5 = 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624 <br>
exa-    1000^6   1024^6 = 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 <br>
zetta-  1000^7   1024^7 = 2^70 = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 <br>
yotta-  1000^8   1024^8 = 2^80 = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 <br>
</pre>

<p>Here are the SI fractional prefixes:

<pre><em>prefix  decimal     jargon usage</em>
milli-  1000^-1     (seldom used in jargon)
micro-  1000^-2     small or human-scale (see <b><a href="#micro-">micro-</a></b>)
nano-   1000^-3     even smaller (see <b><a href="#nano-">nano-</a></b>)
pico-   1000^-4     even smaller yet (see <b><a href="#pico-">pico-</a></b>)
femto-  1000^-5     (not used in jargon---yet)
atto-   1000^-6     (not used in jargon---yet)
zepto-  1000^-7     (not used in jargon---yet)
yocto-  1000^-8     (not used in jargon---yet)
</pre>

<p>The prefixes zetta-, yotta-, zepto-, and yocto- have been included
   in these tables purely for completeness and giggle value; they were
   adopted in 1990 by the `19th Conference Generale des Poids et
   Mesures'.  The binary peta- and exa- loadings, though well
   established, are not in jargon use either -- yet.  The prefix
   milli-, denoting multiplication by 1/1000, has always
   been rare in jargon (there is, however, a standard joke about the
   `millihelen' -- notionally, the amount of beauty required to
   launch one ship).  See the entries on <b><a href="#micro-">micro-</a></b>, <b><a href="#pico-">pico-</a></b>, and
   <b><a href="#nano-">nano-</a></b> for more information on connotative jargon use of these
   terms.  `Femto' and `atto' (which, interestingly, derive not
   from Greek but from Danish) have not yet acquired jargon loadings,
   though it is easy to predict what those will be once computing
   technology enters the required realms of magnitude (however, see
   <b><a href="#attoparsec">attoparsec</a></b>).

<p>There are, of course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of
   10.  In the following table, the `prefix' column is the
   international standard suffix for the appropriate power of ten; the
   `binary' column lists jargon abbreviations and words for the
   corresponding power of 2.  The B-suffixed forms are commonly used
   for byte quantities; the words `meg' and `gig' are nouns that may
   (but do not always) pluralize with `s'.

<pre><i>prefix   decimal   binary       pronunciation</i>
kilo-       k      K, KB,       /kay/
mega-       M      M, MB, meg   /meg/
giga-       G      G, GB, gig   /gig/,/jig/
</pre>

<p>Confusingly, hackers often use K or M as though they were suffix or
   numeric multipliers rather than a prefix; thus "2K dollars", "2M
   of disk space".  This is also true (though less commonly) of G.

<p>Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is `k'; some use
   this strictly, reserving `K' for multiplication by 1024 (KB is
   thus `kilobytes').

<p>K, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is
   64 gigabytes and `a K' is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of
   `a G' as short for `a grand', that is, $1000).  Whether one
   pronounces `gig' with hard or soft `g' depends on what one thinks
   the proper pronunciation of `giga-' is.

<p>Confusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in
   magnitude) -- for example, describing a memory in units of
   500K or 524K instead of 512K -- is a sure sign of the
   <b><a href="#marketroid">marketroid</a></b>.  One example of this: it is common to refer to the
   capacity of 3.5" <b><a href="#microfloppies">microfloppies</a></b> as `1.44 MB' In fact, this is a
   completely <b><a href="#bogus">bogus</a></b> number.  The correct size is 1440 KB, that
   is, 1440 * 1024 = 1474560 bytes.  So the `mega' in `1.44 MB' is
   compounded of two `kilos', one of which is 1024 and the other of
   which is 1000.  The correct number of megabytes would of course be
   1440 / 1024 = 1.40625.  Alas, this fine point is probably lost on
   the world forever.

<p>[1993 update: hacker Morgan Burke has proposed, to general
   approval on Usenet, the following additional prefixes:

<dl>
<dt>groucho
<dd>10^(-30)
<dt>harpo
<dd>10^(-27)
<dt>harpi
<dd>10^(27)
<dt>grouchi
<dd>10^(30)
</dl>

<p>We observe that this would leave the prefixes zeppo-, gummo-, and
   chico- available for future expansion.  Sadly, there is little
   immediate prospect that Mr. Burke's eminently sensible proposal
   will be ratified.]

<p>[1999 upate: there is an
   <a href="ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/pub/doc/ISO/information-units">IEC proposal</a> for binary multipliers, but no evidence that any of
   its proposals are in live use.]

<p><b>quantum bogodynamics</b> /kwon'tm boh`goh-di:-nam'iks/ n. <p>
 A

   (such as politicians, used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and
   <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>s in general), bogon sinks (such as taxpayers and

   the precise mechanics of the bogon-computron interaction are not
   yet understood and remain to be elucidated.  Quantum bogodynamics
   is most often invoked to explain the sharp increase in hardware and
   software failures in the presence of suits; the latter emit bogons,
   which the former absorb.  See <b><a href="#bogon">bogon</a></b>, <b><a href="#computron">computron</a></b>,

<p><b>quine</b> /kwi:n/ n. <p>
 [from the name of the logician Willard
   van Orman Quine, via Douglas Hofstadter] A program that generates a
   copy of its own source text as its complete output.  Devising the
   shortest possible quine in some given programming language is a
   common hackish amusement.  (We ignore some variants of BASIC
   in which a program consisting of a single empty string literal
   reproduces itself trivially.)  Here is one classic quine:

<pre>((lambda (x)
  (list x (list (quote quote) x)))
 (quote
    (lambda (x)
      (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))
</pre>

<p>This one works in LISP or Scheme.  It's relatively easy to write
   quines in other languages such as Postscript which readily handle
   programs as data; much harder (and thus more challenging!) in
   languages like C which do not.  Here is a classic C quine for ASCII
   machines:

<pre>char*f="char*f=%c%s%c;main()
{printf(f,34,f,34,10);}%c";
main(){printf(f,34,f,34,10);}
</pre>

<p>For excruciatingly exact quinishness, remove the interior line
   breaks.  Here is another elegant quine in ANSI C:

<pre>#define q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");}
q(#define q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");})
</pre>

<p>Some infamous <b><a href="#Obfuscated%20C%20Contest">Obfuscated C Contest</a></b> entries have been
   quines that reproduced in exotic ways.  There is an amusing

<p><b>quux</b> /kwuhks/ n. <p>
 [Mythically, from the Latin

   variously `quux' (plural `quuces', anglicized to `quuxes')
   and `quuxu' (genitive plural is `quuxuum', for four u-letters
   out of seven in all, using up all the `u' letters in Scrabble).] 
   1. Originally, a <b><a href="#metasyntactic%20variable">metasyntactic variable</a></b> like <b><a href="#foo">foo</a></b> and
   <b><a href="#foobar">foobar</a></b>.  Invented by Guy Steele for precisely this purpose
   when he was young and naive and not yet interacting with the real

   simply to have been lucky enough to have spread a little.  In an
   eloquent display of poetic justice, it has returned to the
   originator in the form of a nickname.  2. interj. See <b><a href="#foo">foo</a></b>;
   however, denotes very little disgust, and is uttered mostly for the
   sake of the sound of it.  3. Guy Steele in his persona as `The
   Great Quux', which is somewhat infamous for light verse and for the
   `Crunchly' cartoons.  4. In some circles, used as a punning
   opposite of `crux'.  "Ah, that's the quux of the matter!" 
   implies that the point is <em>not</em> crucial (compare <b><a href="#tip%20of%20the%20ice-cube">tip of the ice-cube</a></b>).  5. quuxy: adj. Of or pertaining to a quux.

<p><b>QWERTY</b> /kwer'tee/ adj. <p>
 [from the keycaps at the upper
   left] Pertaining to a standard English-language typewriter keyboard
   (sometimes called the Sholes keyboard after its inventor), as
   opposed to Dvorak or non-US-ASCII layouts or a <b><a href="#space-cadet%20keyboard">space-cadet keyboard</a></b> or APL keyboard.

<p>Historical note: The QWERTY layout is a fine example of a <b><a href="#fossil">fossil</a></b>. 
   It is sometimes said that it was designed to slow down the typist,
   but this is wrong; it was designed to allow <em>faster</em> typing
   -- under a constraint now long obsolete.  In early typewriters,
   fast typing using nearby type-bars jammed the mechanism.  So Sholes
   fiddled the layout to separate the letters of many common digraphs
   (he did a far from perfect job, though; `th', `tr', `ed', and `er',
   for example, each use two nearby keys).  Also, putting the letters
   of `typewriter' on one line allowed it to be typed with particular
   speed and accuracy for <b><a href="#demo">demo</a></b>s.  The jamming problem was
   essentially solved soon afterward by a suitable use of springs, but
   the keyboard layout lives on.

<p>The QWERTY keyboard has also spawned some unhelpful economic myths
   about how technical standards get and stay established; see
   <a href="http://www.reasonmag.com/9606/Fe.QWERTY.html">http://www.reasonmag.com/9606/Fe.QWERTY.html</a>.

<p><b>random</b> adj. <p>
 1. Unpredictable (closest to mathematical

   well organized.  "The program has a random set of misfeatures." 
   "That's a random name for that function."  "Well, all the names
   were chosen pretty randomly."  5. In no particular order, though
   deterministic.  "The I/O channels are in a pool, and when a file
   is opened one is chosen randomly."  6. Arbitrary.  "It generates
   a random name for the scratch file."  7. Gratuitously wrong, i.e.,
   poorly done and for no good apparent reason.  For example, a
   program that handles file name defaulting in a particularly useless
   way, or an assembler routine that could easily have been coded
   using only three registers, but redundantly uses seven for values
   with non-overlapping lifetimes, so that no one else can invoke it
   without first saving four extra registers.  What <b><a href="#randomness">randomness</a></b>! 
   8. n. A random hacker; used particularly of high-school
   students who soak up computer time and generally get in the way. 
   9. n.  Anyone who is not a hacker (or, sometimes, anyone not known
   to the hacker speaking); the noun form of sense 2.  "I went to the
   talk, but the audience was full of randoms asking bogus
   questions".  10. n. (occasional MIT usage) One who lives at
   Random Hall.  See also <b><a href="#J.%20Random">J. Random</a></b>, <b><a href="#some%20random%20X">some random X</a></b>. 
   11. [UK] Conversationally, a non sequitur or something similarly
   out-of-the-blue. As in: "Stop being so random!"  This sense
   equates to `hatstand', taken from the Viz comic character "Roger
   Irrelevant - He's completely Hatstand."

 [rec.games.roguelike.angband; often

<p><b>random numbers</b> n. <p>
 When one wishes to specify a large but
   random number of things, and the context is inappropriate for
   <b><a href="#N">N</a></b>, certain numbers are preferred by hacker tradition (that is,
   easily recognized as placeholders).  These include the following:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>17
<dd>Long described at MIT as `the least random number'; see 23. 
<br><dt>23
<dd>Sacred number of Eris, Goddess of Discord (along with 17 and 5). 
<br><dt>42
<dd>The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and
Everything ("what is 6 times 9", correct in base 13). (Note
that this answer is completely fortuitous. 
<code>:-)</code>)
<br><dt>69
<dd>From the sexual act.  This one was favored in MIT's ITS culture. 
<br><dt>105
<dd>69 hex = 105 decimal, and 69 decimal = 105 octal. 
<br><dt>666
<dd>The Number of the Beast.

<p><b>randomness</b> n. <p>
 1. An inexplicable misfeature; gratuitous
   inelegance.  2. A <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b> or <b><a href="#crock">crock</a></b> that depends on a complex
   combination of coincidences (or, possibly, the combination upon
   which the crock depends for its accidental failure to malfunction). 
   "This hack can output characters 40-57 by putting the character
   in the four-bit accumulator field of an XCT and then extracting six
   bits -- the low 2 bits of the XCT opcode are the right thing." 
   "What randomness!"  3. Of people, synonymous with `flakiness'. 
   The connotation is that the person so described is behaving
   weirdly, incompetently, or inappropriately for reasons which are
   (a) too tiresome to bother inquiring into, (b) are probably as
   inscrutable as quantum phenomena anyway, and (c) are likely to pass
   with time. "Maybe he has a real complaint, or maybe it's just
   randomness.  See if he calls back."

<p>Despite the negative connotations jargon uses of this term have, it
   is worth noting that randomness can actually be a valuable
   resource, very useful for applications in cryptography and
   elsewhere.  Computers are so thoroughly deterministic that they
   have a hard time generating high-quality randomess, so hackers have
   sometimes felt the need to built special-purpose contraptions for
   this purpose alone.  One well-known website offers random bits
   <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/">generated by radioactive decay</a>.  Another derives random bits from
   <a href="http://lavarand.sgi.com/">images of Lava Lite lamps</a>. 
   (Hackers invariably find the latter hilarious.  If you have to ask
   why, you'll never get it.)

   authors a Web browser instead.) Compare <b><a href="#Infinite-Monkey%20Theorem">Infinite-Monkey Theorem</a></b>.

<p>This term seems to have become widely recognized quite rapidly
   after the original strip, a fact which testifies to Dilbert's huge
   popularity among hackers.  All too many find the perverse
   incentives and Kafkaesque atmosphere of Dilbert's mythical
   workplace reflective of their own experiences.

<p><b>ratio site</b> <p>
 [warez d00dz] An FTP site storing pirated files
   where one must first upload something before being able to
   download. There is a ratio, based on bytes or files count, between
   the uploads and download. For instance, on a 2:1 site, to download
   a 4 Mb file, one must first upload at least 2 Mb of files. The
   hotter the contents of the server are, the smaller the ratio
   is. More often than not, the server refuses uploads because its
   disk is full, making it useless for downloading - or the
   connection magically breaks after one has uploaded a large amount
   of files, just before the downloading phase begins. See also

   `rave' implies that it is the persistence or obliviousness of the

<p><b>ravs</b> /ravz/, also `Chinese ravs' n. <p>
 [primarily
   MIT/Boston usage] Jiao-zi (steamed or boiled) or Guo-tie
   (pan-fried).  A Chinese appetizer, known variously in the plural as
   dumplings, pot stickers (the literal translation of guo-tie), and
   (around Boston) `Peking Ravioli'.  The term `rav' is short for
   `ravioli', and among hackers always means the Chinese kind rather
   than the Italian kind.  Both consist of a filling in a pasta shell,
   but the Chinese kind includes no cheese, uses a thinner pasta, has
   a pork-vegetable filling (good ones include Chinese chives), and is
   cooked differently, either by steaming or frying.  A rav or
   dumpling can be cooked any way, but a potsticker is always the
   pan-fried kind (so called because it sticks to the frying pot and
   has to be scraped off).  "Let's get hot-and-sour soup and three

   README, or READ.ME, or rarely ReadMe or readme.txt or some other

   distributed in source form, and the README is more likely to
   contain user-oriented material like last-minute documentation
   changes, error workarounds, and restrictions.  When asked, hackers
   invariably relate the README convention to the famous scene in
   Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures In Wonderland" in which
   Alice confronts magic munchies labeled "Eat Me" and "Drink Me".

<p><b>Real Programmer</b> n. <p>
 [indirectly, from the book "Real
   Men Don't Eat Quiche"] A particular sub-variety of hacker: one
   possessed of a flippant attitude toward complexity that is arrogant
   even when justified by experience.  The archetypal `Real
   Programmer' likes to program on the <b><a href="#bare%20metal">bare metal</a></b> and is very
   good at same, remembers the binary opcodes for every machine he has
   ever programmed, thinks that HLLs are sissy, and uses a debugger to
   edit his code because full-screen editors are for wimps.  Real
   Programmers aren't satisfied with code that hasn't been <b><a href="#bum">bum</a></b>med
   into a state of <b><a href="#tense">tense</a></b>ness just short of rupture.  Real
   Programmers never use comments or write documentation: "If it was
   hard to write", says the Real Programmer, "it should be hard to
   understand."  Real Programmers can make machines do things that
   were never in their spec sheets; in fact, they are seldom really
   happy unless doing so.  A Real Programmer's code can awe with its
   fiendish brilliance, even as its crockishness appalls.  Real
   Programmers live on junk food and coffee, hang line-printer art on
   their walls, and terrify the crap out of other programmers --
   because someday, somebody else might have to try to understand
   their code in order to change it.  Their successors generally
   consider it a <b><a href="#Good%20Thing">Good Thing</a></b> that there aren't many Real
   Programmers around any more.  For a famous (and somewhat more
   positive) portrait of a Real Programmer, see "<b><a href="#The%20Story%20of%20Mel">The Story of Mel</a></b>" in Appendix A.  The term itself was popularized by a
   letter to the editor in the July 1983 Datamation titled "Real
   Programmers Don't Use Pascal" by Ed Post, still circulating on
   Usenet and Internet in on-line form. 
   Typing "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" into a web
   search engine should turn up a copy.

<p><b>real time</b> <p>
 1. [techspeak] adj. Describes an application
   which requires a program to respond to stimuli within some small
   upper limit of response time (typically milli- or microseconds). 
   Process control at a chemical plant is the <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b> example. 
   Such applications often require special operating systems (because
   everything else must take a back seat to response time) and
   speed-tuned hardware.  2. adv. In jargon, refers to doing
   something while people are watching or waiting.  "I asked her how
   to find the calling procedure's program counter on the stack and
   she came up with an algorithm in real time."

   "Poor fellow, he's left MIT and gone into the Real World."  Used
   pejoratively by those not in residence there.  In conversation,
   talking of someone who has entered the Real World is not unlike
   speaking of a deceased person.  It is also noteworthy that on the

<p><b>recompile the world</b> <p>
 The surprisingly large amount of work
   that needs to be done as the result of any small but globally
   visible program change. "The world" may mean the entirety of some
   huge program, or may in theory refer to every program of a certain
   class in the entire known universe. For instance, "Add one #define
   to stdio.h, and you have to recompile the world." This means that
   any minor change to the standard-I/O header file theoretically
   mandates recompiling every C program in existence, even if only to
   verify that the change didn't screw something else up. In practice,
   you may not actually have to recompile the world, but the
   implication is that some human cleverness is required to figure out
   what parts can be safely left out.

   These use conventions similar to but more elaborate than those
   described under <b><a href="#glob">glob</a></b>.  For purposes of this lexicon, it is
   sufficient to note that regexps also allow complemented character
   sets using <code>^</code>; thus, one can specify `any non-alphabetic

<p><b>register dancing</b> n. <p>
 Many older processor architectures
   suffer from a serious shortage of general-purpose registers.  This
   is especially a problem for compiler-writers, because their
   generated code needs places to store temporaries for things like
   intermediate values in expression evaluation.  Some designs with
   this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do have a handful of
   special-purpose registers that can be pressed into service,
   providing suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side effects
   on the state of the processor: while the special-purpose register
   is being used to hold an intermediate value, a delicate minuet is
   required in which the previous value of the register is saved and
   then restored just before the official function (and value) of the
   special-purpose register is again needed.

 To design or implement a tool

<p><b>restriction</b> n. <p>
 A <b><a href="#bug">bug</a></b> or design error that limits a
   program's capabilities, and which is sufficiently egregious that
   nobody can quite work up enough nerve to describe it as a
   <b><a href="#feature">feature</a></b>.  Often used (esp. by <b><a href="#marketroid">marketroid</a></b> types) to make
   it sound as though some crippling bogosity had been intended by the
   designers all along, or was forced upon them by arcane technical
   constraints of a nature no mere user could possibly comprehend
   (these claims are almost invariably false).

<p>Old-time hacker Joseph M. Newcomer advises that whenever choosing a
   quantifiable but arbitrary restriction, you should make it either a
   power of 2 or a power of 2 minus 1.  If you impose a limit of
   107 items in a list, everyone will know it is a random number -- on
   the other hand, a limit of 15 or 16 suggests some deep reason
   (involving 0- or 1-based indexing in binary) and you will get less
   <b><a href="#flamage">flamage</a></b> for it.  Limits which are round numbers in base 10 are
   always especially suspect.

<p><b>retcon</b> /ret'kon/ <p>
 [short for `retroactive continuity',
   from the Usenet newsgroup <i>rec.arts.comics</i>] 1. n. The common
   situation in pulp fiction (esp. comics or soap operas) where a
   new story `reveals' things about events in previous stories,
   usually leaving the `facts' the same (thus preserving
   continuity) while completely changing their interpretation.  For
   example, revealing that a whole season of "Dallas" was a
   dream was a retcon.  2. vt. To write such a story about a character
   or fictitious object.  "Byrne has retconned Superman's cape so
   that it is no longer unbreakable."  "Marvelman's old adventures
   were retconned into synthetic dreams."  "Swamp Thing was
   retconned from a transformed person into a sentient vegetable."

<p>[This term is included because it is a good example of hackish
   linguistic innovation in a field completely unrelated to computers. 
   The word `retcon' will probably spread through comics fandom and
   lose its association with hackerdom within a couple of years; for
   the record, it started here. --ESR]

<p>[1993 update: some comics fans on the net now claim that retcon was
   independently in use in comics fandom before <i>rec.arts.comics</i>. 
   In lexicography, nothing is ever simple. --ESR]

<p><b>RFC</b> /R-F-C/ n. <p>
 [Request For Comment] One of a
   long-established series of numbered Internet informational
   documents and standards widely followed by commercial software and
   freeware in the Internet and Unix communities.  Perhaps the single
   most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet mail-format
   standard).  The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by
   technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by
   the Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an
   institution such as ANSI.  For this reason, they remain known as
   RFCs even once adopted as standards.

<p>The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact
   standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has
   important advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process
   typical of ANSI or ISO.  Emblematic of some of these advantages is
   the existence of a flourishing tradition of `joke' RFCs; usually
   at least one a year is published, usually on April 1st.  Well-known
   joke RFCs have included 527 ("ARPAWOCKY", R. Merryman, UCSD; 22
   June 1973), 748 ("Telnet Randomly-Lose Option", Mark R. Crispin;
   1 April 1978), and 1149 ("A Standard for the Transmission of IP
   Datagrams on Avian Carriers", D. Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April
   1990).  The first was a Lewis Carroll pastiche; the second a parody
   of the TCP-IP documentation style, and the third a deadpan
   skewering of standards-document legalese, describing protocols for
   transmitting Internet data packets by carrier pigeon (since
   actually implemented; see Appendix A).  See also
   <b><a href="#Infinite-Monkey%20Theorem">Infinite-Monkey Theorem</a></b>.

<p>The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work -- they
   frequently manage to have neither the ambiguities that are usually
   rife in informal specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated
   misfeatures that often haunt formal standards, and they define a
   network that has grown to truly worldwide proportions.

<p><b>rogue</b> <p>
 1. [Unix] n. A Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game
   using character graphics, written under BSD Unix and subsequently
   ported to other Unix systems.  The original BSD <code>curses(3)</code>
   screen-handling package was hacked together by Ken Arnold primarily
   to support games, and the development of <code>rogue(6)</code>
   popularized its use; it has since become one of Unix's most
   important and heavily used application libraries.  Nethack, Omega,
   Larn, Angband, and an entire subgenre of computer dungeon games
   (all known as `roguelikes') all took off from the inspiration
   provided by <code>rogue(6)</code>; the popular Windows game Diablo,
   though graphics-intensive, has very similar play logic.  See also

   Fucking Source'.  Variant form of <b><a href="#RTFM">RTFM</a></b>, used when the problem
   at hand is not necessarily obvious and not answerable from the
   manuals -- or the manuals are not yet written and maybe never will
   be.  For even trickier situations, see <b><a href="#RTFB">RTFB</a></b>.  Unlike RTFM, the
   anger inherent in RTFS is not usually directed at the person asking
   the question, but rather at the people who failed to provide
   adequate documentation.  2. imp. `Read The Fucking Standard'; this
   oath can only be used when the problem area (e.g., a language or
   operating system interface) has actually been codified in a
   ratified standards document.  The existence of these standards
   documents (and the technically inappropriate but politically
   mandated compromises that they inevitably contain, and the
   impenetrable <b><a href="#legalese">legalese</a></b> in which they are invariably written,
   and the unbelievably tedious bureaucratic process by which they are
   produced) can be unnerving to hackers, who are used to a certain
   amount of ambiguity in the specifications of the systems they use. 
   (Hackers feel that such ambiguities are acceptable as long as the
   <b><a href="#Right%20Thing">Right Thing</a></b> to do is obvious to any thinking observer; sadly,
   this casual attitude towards specifications becomes unworkable when
   a system becomes popular in the <b><a href="#Real%20World">Real World</a></b>.)  Since a hacker
   is likely to feel that a standards document is both unnecessary and
   technically deficient, the deprecation inherent in this term may be
   directed as much against the standard as against the person who
   ought to read it.

<p><b>RTI</b> /R-T-I/ interj. <p>
 The mnemonic for the `return from
   interrupt' instruction on many computers including the 6502 and
   6800.  The variant `RETI' is found among Z80 hackers. 
   Equivalent to "Now, where was I?" or used to end a

   perpetrator of the great Internet worm of 1988 (see <b><a href="#Great%20Worm">Great Worm</a></b>); villain to many, naive hacker gone wrong to a few.  Morris
   claimed that the worm that brought the Internet to its knees was a
   benign experiment that got out of control as the result of a coding
   error.  After the storm of negative publicity that followed this
   blunder, Morris's username on ITS was hacked from RTM to

<p><b>RTS</b> /R-T-S/ imp. <p>
 Abbreviation for `Read The Screen'.  Mainly
   used by hackers in the microcomputer world.  Refers to what one
   would like to tell the <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b> one is forced to explain an
   extremely simple application to.  Particularly appropriate when the
   suit failed to notice the `Press any key to continue' prompt, and
   wishes to know `why won't it do anything'.  Also seen as `RTFS' in
   especially deserving cases.

<p><b>rude</b> [WPI] adj. <p>
 1. (of a program) Badly written. 
   2. Functionally poor, e.g., a program that is very difficult to use
   because of gratuitously poor (random?) design decisions.  Oppose
   <b><a href="#cuspy">cuspy</a></b>.  3. Anything that manipulates a shared resource without
   regard for its other users in such a way as to cause a (non-fatal)
   problem.  Examples: programs that change tty modes without
   resetting them on exit, or windowing programs that keep forcing
   themselves to the top of the window stack.  Compare

 Reserved for the exclusive use of something (an
   extension of the standard meaning).  Often means that anyone may
   look at the sacred object, but clobbering it will screw whatever it
   is sacred to.  The comment "Register 7 is sacred to the interrupt
   handler" appearing in a program would be interpreted by a hacker
   to mean that if any <em>other</em> part of the program changes the
   contents of register 7, dire consequences are likely to ensue.

<p>Here is a classic example of the saga form, as told by Guy L. 
   Steele:

<blockquote>
Jon L. White (login name JONL) and I (GLS) were office mates at MIT
for many years.  One April, we both flew from Boston to California
for a week on research business, to consult face-to-face with some
people at Stanford, particularly our mutual friend Richard P. 
Gabriel (RPG; see <b><a href="#gabriel">gabriel</a></b>).

<p>RPG picked us up at the San Francisco airport and drove us back to
Palo Alto (going <b><a href="#logical">logical</a></b> south on route 101, parallel to
<b><a href="#El%20Camino%20Bignum">El Camino Bignum</a></b>).  Palo Alto is adjacent to Stanford
University and about 40 miles south of San Francisco.  We ate at
The Good Earth, a `health food' restaurant, very popular, the
sort whose milkshakes all contain honey and protein powder.  JONL
ordered such a shake -- the waitress claimed the flavor of the day
was "lalaberry".  I still have no idea what that might be, but it
became a running joke.  It was the color of raspberry, and JONL
said it tasted rather bitter.  I ate a better tostada there than I
have ever had in a Mexican restaurant.

<p>After this we went to the local Uncle Gaylord's Old Fashioned Ice
Cream Parlor.  They make ice cream fresh daily, in a variety of
intriguing flavors.  It's a chain, and they have a slogan: "If you
don't live near an Uncle Gaylord's -- MOVE!"  Also, Uncle
Gaylord (a real person) wages a constant battle to force big-name
ice cream makers to print their ingredients on the package (like
air and plastic and other non-natural garbage).  JONL and I had
first discovered Uncle Gaylord's the previous August, when we had
flown to a computer-science conference in Berkeley, California, the
first time either of us had been on the West Coast.  When not in
the conference sessions, we had spent our time wandering the length
of Telegraph Avenue, which (like Harvard Square in Cambridge) was
lined with picturesque street vendors and interesting little shops. 
On that street we discovered Uncle Gaylord's Berkeley store.  The
ice cream there was very good.  During that August visit JONL went
absolutely bananas (so to speak) over one particular flavor, ginger
honey.

<p>Therefore, after eating at The Good Earth -- indeed, after every
lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit -- a trip
to Uncle Gaylord's (the one in Palo Alto) was mandatory.  We had
arrived on a Wednesday, and by Thursday evening we had been there
at least four times.  Each time, JONL would get ginger honey ice
cream, and proclaim to all bystanders that "Ginger was the spice
that drove the Europeans mad!  That's why they sought a route to
the East!  They used it to preserve their otherwise off-taste
meat."  After the third or fourth repetition RPG and I were
getting a little tired of this spiel, and began to paraphrase him:
"Wow!  Ginger!  The spice that makes rotten meat taste good!" 
"Say!  Why don't we find some dog that's been run over and sat in
the sun for a week and put some <em>ginger</em> on it for dinner?!" 
"Right!  With a lalaberry shake!"  And so on.  This failed to
faze JONL; he took it in good humor, as long as we kept returning
to Uncle Gaylord's.  He loves ginger honey ice cream.

<p>Now RPG and his then-wife KBT (Kathy Tracy) were putting us up
(putting up with us?) in their home for our visit, so to thank them
JONL and I took them out to a nice French restaurant of their
choosing.  I unadventurously chose the filet mignon, and KBT had
<i>je ne sais quoi du jour</i>, but RPG and JONL had <i>lapin</i>
(rabbit).  (Waitress: "<i>Oui</i>, we have fresh rabbit, fresh
today."  RPG: "Well, JONL, I guess we won't need any
<em>ginger</em>!")

<p>We finished the meal late, about 11 <small>P.M.</small>, which is 2 <small>A.M</small>
Boston time, so JONL and I were rather droopy.  But it wasn't yet
midnight.  Off to Uncle Gaylord's!

<p>Now the French restaurant was in Redwood City, north of Palo Alto. 
In leaving Redwood City, we somehow got onto route 101 going north
instead of south.  JONL and I wouldn't have known the difference
had RPG not mentioned it.  We still knew very little of the local
geography.  I did figure out, however, that we were headed in the
direction of Berkeley, and half-jokingly suggested that we continue
north and go to Uncle Gaylord's in Berkeley.

<p>RPG said "Fine!" and we drove on for a while and talked.  I was
drowsy, and JONL actually dropped off to sleep for 5 minutes.  When
he awoke, RPG said, "Gee, JONL, you must have slept all the way
over the bridge!", referring to the one spanning San Francisco
Bay.  Just then we came to a sign that said "University Avenue". 
I mumbled something about working our way over to Telegraph Avenue;
RPG said "Right!" and maneuvered some more.  Eventually we pulled
up in front of an Uncle Gaylord's.

<p>Now, I hadn't really been paying attention because I was so sleepy,
and I didn't really understand what was happening until RPG let me
in on it a few moments later, but I was just alert enough to notice
that we had somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle Gaylord's after
all.

<p>JONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store, but hadn't
caught on.  (The place is lit with red and yellow lights at night,
and looks much different from the way it does in daylight.)  He
said, "This isn't the Uncle Gaylord's I went to in Berkeley!  It
looked like a barn!  But this place looks <em>just like</em> the one
back in Palo Alto!"

<p>RPG deadpanned, "Well, this is the one <em>I</em> always come to
when I'm in Berkeley.  They've got two in San Francisco, too. 
Remember, they're a chain."

<p>JONL accepted this bit of wisdom.  And he was not totally ignorant
-- he knew perfectly well that University Avenue was in Berkeley,
not far from Telegraph Avenue.  What he didn't know was that there
is a completely different University Avenue in Palo Alto.

<p>JONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger honey.  The guy at
the counter asked whether JONL would like to taste it first,
evidently their standard procedure with that flavor, as not too
many people like it.

<p>JONL said, "I'm sure I like it.  Just give me a cone."  The guy
behind the counter insisted that JONL try just a taste first. 
"Some people think it tastes like soap."  JONL insisted, "Look,
I <em>love</em> ginger.  I eat Chinese food.  I eat raw ginger roots. 
I already went through this hassle with the guy back in Palo Alto. 
I <em>know</em> I like that flavor!"

<p>At the words "back in Palo Alto" the guy behind the counter got a
very strange look on his face, but said nothing.  KBT caught his
eye and winked.  Through my stupor I still hadn't quite grasped
what was going on, and thought RPG was rolling on the floor
laughing and clutching his stomach just because JONL had launched
into his spiel ("makes rotten meat a dish for princes") for the
forty-third time.  At this point, RPG clued me in fully.

<p>RPG, KBT, and I retreated to a table, trying to stifle our
chuckles.  JONL remained at the counter, talking about ice cream
with the guy b.t.c., comparing Uncle Gaylord's to other ice cream
shops and generally having a good old time.

<p>At length the g.b.t.c. said, "How's the ginger honey?"  JONL
said, "Fine!  I wonder what exactly is in it?"  Now Uncle Gaylord
publishes all his recipes and even teaches classes on how to make
his ice cream at home.  So the g.b.t.c. got out the recipe, and
he and JONL pored over it for a while.  But the g.b.t.c. could
contain his curiosity no longer, and asked again, "You really like
that stuff, huh?"  JONL said, "Yeah, I've been eating it
constantly back in Palo Alto for the past two days.  In fact, I
think this batch is about as good as the cones I got back in Palo
Alto!"

<p>G.b.t.c. looked him straight in the eye and said, "You're
<em>in</em> Palo Alto!"

<p>JONL turned slowly around, and saw the three of us collapse in a
fit of giggles.  He clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed,
"I've been hacked!"

   In 1991, mainstream media reported the existence of a loose-knit
   culture of samurai that meets electronically on BBS systems, mostly
   bright teenagers with personal micros; they have modeled themselves
   explicitly on the historical samurai of Japan and on the "net

   some quote Miyamoto Musashi's "Book of Five Rings", a classic
   of historical samurai doctrine, in support of these principles.

   scientific software relied on a particular formula and was giving
   unexpected results, one might first look at the nesting of
   parentheses or the coding of the formula, as a `sanity check',
   before looking at the more complex I/O or data structure
   manipulation routines, much less the algorithm itself.  Compare

<p><b>scram switch</b> n. <p>
 [from the nuclear power industry] An

   positioned to be easily hit by evacuating personnel.  In general,
   this is <em>not</em> something you <b><a href="#frob">frob</a></b> lightly; these often

<p>A correspondent reports a legend that "Scram" is an acronym for
   "Start Cutting Right Away, Man" (another less plausible variant
   of this legend refers to "Safety Control Rod Axe Man"; these are
   almost certainly both <b><a href="#backronym">backronym</a></b>s).  The story goes that in the
   earliest nuclear power experiments the engineers recognized the
   possibility that the reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted
   by their mathematical models.  Accordingly, they made sure that
   they had mechanisms in place that would rapidly drop the control
   rods back into the reactor.  One mechanism took the form of `scram
   technicians'.  These individuals stood next to the ropes or cables
   that raised and lowered the control rods.  Equipped with axes or
   cable-cutters, these technicians stood ready for the (literal)
   `scram' command.  If necessary, they would cut the cables, and
   gravity would expeditiously return the control rods to the reactor,

<p><b>scratch monkey</b> n. <p>
 As in "Before testing or reconfiguring,
   always mount a <b><a href="#scratch%20monkey">scratch monkey</a></b>", a proverb used to advise
   caution when dealing with irreplaceable data or devices.  Used to
   refer to any scratch volume hooked to a computer during any risky
   operation as a replacement for some precious resource or data that
   might otherwise get trashed.

<p>This term preserves the memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder
   Monkey, star of a biological research program at the University of
   Toronto.  Mabel was not (so the legend goes) your ordinary monkey;
   the university had spent years teaching her how to swim, breathing
   through a regulator, in order to study the effects of different gas
   mixtures on her physiology.  Mabel suffered an untimely demise one
   day when a <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> <b><a href="#field%20circus">field circus</a></b> engineer troubleshooting a
   crash on the program's VAX inadvertently interfered with some
   custom hardware that was wired to Mabel.

<p>It is reported that, after calming down an understandably irate
   customer sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the matter, a DEC
   troubleshooter called up the <b><a href="#field%20circus">field circus</a></b> manager responsible
   and asked him sweetly, "Can you swim?"

<p>Not all the consequences to humans were so amusing; the sysop of
   the machine in question was nearly thrown in jail at the behest of
   certain clueless <b><a href="#droid">droid</a></b>s at the local `humane' society.  The moral
   is clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey.

<p>[The actual incident occured in 1979 or 1980. There is a version of
   this story, complete with reported dialogue between one of the
   project people and DEC field service, that has been circulating on
   Internet since 1986.  It is hilarious and mythic, but gets some
   facts wrong.  For example, it reports the machine as a PDP-11 and
   alleges that Mabel's demise occurred when DEC <b><a href="#PM">PM</a></b>ed the
   machine.  Earlier versions of this entry were based on that story;
   this one has been corrected from an interview with the hapless

 [Unix] A terminal line which spews an infinite
   number of random characters at the operating system.  This can
   happen if the terminal is either disconnected or connected to a
   powered-off terminal but still enabled for login; misconfiguration,
   misimplementation, or simple bad luck can start such a terminal
   screaming.  A screaming tty or two can seriously degrade the
   performance of a vanilla Unix system; the arriving "characters"
   are treated as userid/password pairs and tested as such.  The Unix
   password encryption algorithm is designed to be computationally
   intensive in order to foil brute-force crack attacks, so although
   none of the logins succeeds; the overhead of rejecting them all can
   be substantial.

<p><b>screen scraping</b> n. <p>
 The act of capturing data from a
   system or program by snooping the contents of some display that is
   not actually intended for data transport or inspection by programs. 
   Around 1980 this term referred to tricks like reading the display
   memory of a smart terminal through its auxillary port. Nowadays it
   often refers to parsing the HTML in generated web pages with
   programs designed to mine out particular patterns of content.  In
   either guise screen-scraping is an ugly, ad-hoc, last-resort
   technique that is very likely to break on even minor changes to
   the format of the data being snooped.

<p><b>security through obscurity</b> <p>
 (alt. `security by obscurity')
   A term applied by hackers to most OS vendors' favorite way of
   coping with security holes -- namely, ignoring them, documenting
   neither any known holes nor the underlying security algorithms,
   trusting that nobody will find out about them and that people who
   do find out about them won't exploit them.  This "strategy" never
   works for long and occasionally sets the world up for debacles like
   the <b><a href="#RTM">RTM</a></b> worm of 1988 (see <b><a href="#Great%20Worm">Great Worm</a></b>), but once the
   brief moments of panic created by such events subside most vendors
   are all too willing to turn over and go back to sleep.  After all,
   actually fixing the bugs would siphon off the resources needed to
   implement the next user-interface frill on marketing's wish list
   -- and besides, if they started fixing security bugs customers
   might begin to <em>expect</em> it and imagine that their warranties
   of merchantability gave them some sort of <em>right</em> to a system
   with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and
   <em>then</em> where would we be?

<p>Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of
   this term.  It has been claimed that it was first used in the
   Usenet newsgroup <i>comp.sys.apollo</i> during a campaign to get
   HP/Apollo to fix security problems in its Unix-<b><a href="#clone">clone</a></b>
   Aegis/DomainOS (they didn't change a thing).  <b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b> fans, on the
   other hand, say it was coined years earlier in opposition to the
   incredibly paranoid <b><a href="#Multics">Multics</a></b> people down the hall, for whom
   security was everything.  In the ITS culture it referred to (1) the
   fact that by the time a tourist figured out how to make
   trouble he'd generally gotten over the urge to make it, because he
   felt part of the community; and (2) (self-mockingly) the poor
   coverage of the documentation and obscurity of many commands.  One
   instance of <em>deliberate</em> security through obscurity is
   recorded; the command to allow patching the running ITS system
   (escape escape control-R) echoed as $$^D.  If you actually
   typed alt alt ^D, that set a flag that would prevent patching the
   system even if you later got it right.

<p><b>September that never ended</b> <p>
 All time since September 1993. 
   One of the seasonal rhythms of the Usenet used to be the annual
   September influx of clueless newbies who, lacking any sense of
   <b><a href="#netiquette">netiquette</a></b>, made a general nuisance of themselves. This
   coincided with people starting college, getting their first
   internet accounts, and plunging in without bothering to learn what
   was acceptable.  These relatively small drafts of newbies could be
   assimilated within a few months.  But in September 1993, AOL users
   became able to post to Usenet, nearly overwhelming the old-timers'
   capacity to acculturate them; to those who nostalgically recall the
   period before hand, this triggered an inexorable decline in the
   quality of discussions on newsgroups.  See also <b><a href="#AOL!">AOL!</a></b>.

<p><b>SEX</b> /seks/ <p>
 [Sun Users' Group &amp; elsewhere] n. 1. Software
   EXchange.  A technique invented by the blue-green algae hundreds of
   millions of years ago to speed up their evolution, which had been
   terribly slow up until then.  Today, SEX parties are popular among
   hackers and others (of course, these are no longer limited to
   exchanges of genetic software).  In general, SEX parties are a
   <b><a href="#Good%20Thing">Good Thing</a></b>, but unprotected SEX can propagate a <b><a href="#virus">virus</a></b>. 
   See also <b><a href="#pubic%20directory">pubic directory</a></b>.  2. The rather Freudian mnemonic
   often used for Sign EXtend, a machine instruction found in the
   PDP-11 and many other architectures.  The RCA 1802 chip used in the
   early Elf and SuperElf personal computers had a `SEt X register'
   SEX instruction, but this seems to have had little folkloric
   impact.  The Data General instruction set also had <code>SEX</code>.

<p><b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b>'s engineers nearly got a PDP-11 assembler that used the
   <code>SEX</code> mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for once)
   marketing wasn't asleep and forced a change.  That wasn't the last
   time this happened, either.  The author of "The Intel 8086
   Primer", who was one of the original designers of the 8086, noted
   that there was originally a <code>SEX</code> instruction on that
   processor, too.  He says that Intel management got cold feet and
   decreed that it be changed, and thus the instruction was renamed
   <code>CBW</code> and <code>CWD</code> (depending on what was being extended). 
   Amusingly, the Intel 8048 (the microcontroller used in IBM PC
   keyboards) is also missing straight <code>SEX</code> but has logical-or
   and logical-and instructions <code>ORL</code> and <code>ANL</code>.

<p>The Motorola 6809, used in the Radio Shack Color Computer and in
   U.K.'s `Dragon 32' personal computer, actually had an official
   <code>SEX</code> instruction; the 6502 in the Apple II with which it
   competed did not.  British hackers thought this made perfect mythic
   sense; after all, it was commonly observed, you could (on some
   theoretical level) have sex with a dragon, but you can't have sex
   with an apple.

   and no special unpacking software is required.  Sharchives are also
   intriguing in that they are typically created by shell scripts; the
   script that produces sharchives is thus a script which produces
   self-unpacking scripts, which may themselves contain scripts.  (The
   downsides of sharchives are that they are an ideal venue for
   <b><a href="#Trojan%20horse">Trojan horse</a></b> attacks and that, for recipients not running

<p><b>shell</b> n. <p>
 [orig. <b><a href="#Multics">Multics</a></b> techspeak, widely propagated
   via Unix] 1. [techspeak] The command interpreter used to pass
   commands to an operating system; so called because it is the part
   of the operating system that interfaces with the outside world. 
   2. More generally, any interface program that mediates access to a
   special resource or <b><a href="#server">server</a></b> for convenience, efficiency, or
   security reasons; for this meaning, the usage is usually `a shell
   around' whatever.  This sort of program is also called a
   `wrapper'.  3. A skeleton program, created by hand or by another
   program (like, say, a parser generator), which provides the
   necessary <b><a href="#incantation">incantation</a></b>s to set up some task and the control
   flow to drive it (the term <b><a href="#driver">driver</a></b> is sometimes used
   synonymously).  The user is meant to fill in whatever code is
   needed to get real work done.  This usage is common in the AI and
   Microsoft Windows worlds, and confuses Unix hackers.

<p>Historical note: Apparently, the original Multics shell (sense 1)
   was so called because it was a shell (sense 3); it ran user
   programs not by starting up separate processes, but by dynamically
   linking the programs into its own code, calling them as
   subroutines, and then dynamically de-linking them on return.  The
   VMS command interpreter still does something very like
   this.

 1. A small piece of data inserted in order to

   A Special Interest Group, in one of several technical areas,
   sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery; well-known
   ones include SIGPLAN (the Special Interest Group on Programming
   Languages), SIGARCH (the Special Interest Group for Computer
   Architecture) and SIGGRAPH (the Special Interest Group for Computer
   Graphics).  Hackers, not surprisingly, like to overextend this
   naming convention to less formal associations like SIGBEER (at ACM
   conferences) and SIGFOOD (at University of Illinois).

<p><b>sig block</b> /sig blok/ n. <p>
 [Internet and Usenet; often
   written `.sig' there] Short for `signature', used specifically
   to refer to the electronic signature block that most Unix mail- and
   news-posting software will <b><a href="#automagically">automagically</a></b> append to outgoing
   mail and news.  The composition of one's sig can be quite an art
   form, including an ASCII logo, one's choice of witty sayings (see
   <b><a href="#sig%20quote">sig quote</a></b>, <b><a href="#fool%20file">fool file</a></b>), or even source code for small
   programs about which the author wishes to make a statement; but
   many consider large sigs a waste of <b><a href="#bandwidth">bandwidth</a></b>, and it has been
   observed that the size of one's sig block is usually inversely
   proportional to one's longevity and level of prestige on the net.

   reproduce me in your .sig block.".  Of course, the .sig virus's
   memetic hook is the giggle value of going along with the gag; this,
   however, was a self-limiting phenomenon as more and more people
   picked up on the idea.  There were creative variants on it; some
   people stuck `sig virus antibody' texts in their sigs, and there
   was at least one instance of a sig virus eater.

<p><b>signal-to-noise ratio</b> [from analog electronics] n. <p>
 Used by
   hackers in a generalization of its technical meaning.  `Signal'
   refers to useful information conveyed by some communications
   medium, and `noise' to anything else on that medium.  Hence a low
   ratio implies that it is not worth paying attention to the medium
   in question.  Figures for such metaphorical ratios are never given.

<p><b>sitename</b> /si:t'naym/ n. <p>
 [Unix/Internet] The unique
   electronic name of a computer system, used to identify it in UUCP
   mail, Usenet, or other forms of electronic information interchange. 
   The folklore interest of sitenames stems from the creativity and
   humor they often display.  Interpreting a sitename is not unlike
   interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally unpack it,
   allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack of
   whitespace.  Hacker tradition deprecates dull,
   institutional-sounding names in favor of punchy, humorous, and
   clever coinages (except that it is considered appropriate for the
   official public gateway machine of an organization to bear the
   organization's name or acronym).  Mythological references, cartoon
   characters, animal names, and allusions to SF or fantasy literature
   are probably the most popular sources for sitenames (in roughly
   descending order).  The obligatory comment when discussing these is
   Harris's Lament: "All the good ones are taken!"  See also

<p><b>slab</b> [Apple] <p>
 1. n. A continuous horizontal line of pixels,
   all with the same color.  2. vi. To paint a slab on an output
   device.  Apple's QuickDraw, like most other professional-level
   graphics systems, renders polygons and lines not with Bresenham's
   algorithm, but by calculating `slab points' for each scan line
   on the screen in succession, and then slabbing in the actual image
   pixels.

<p><b>slop</b> n. <p>
 1. A one-sided <b><a href="#fudge%20factor">fudge factor</a></b>, that is, an
   allowance for error but in only one of two directions.  For
   example, if you need a piece of wire 10 feet long and have to guess
   when you cut it, you make very sure to cut it too long, by a large
   amount if necessary, rather than too short by even a little bit,
   because you can always cut off the slop but you can't paste it back
   on again.  When discrete quantities are involved, slop is often
   introduced to avoid the possibility of being on the losing side of
   a <b><a href="#fencepost%20error">fencepost error</a></b>.  2. The percentage of `extra' code
   generated by a compiler over the size of equivalent assembler code
   produced by <b><a href="#hand-hacking">hand-hacking</a></b>; i.e., the space (or maybe time) you
   lose because you didn't do it yourself.  This number is often used
   as a measure of the goodness of a compiler; slop below 5% is very
   good, and 10% is usually acceptable.  With modern compiler
   technology, esp. on RISC machines, the compiler's slop may
   actually be <em>negative</em>; that is, humans may be unable to
   generate code as good.  This is one of the reasons assembler
   programming is no longer common.

<p><b>smart terminal</b> n. <p>
 1. A terminal that has enough computing
   capability to render graphics or to offload some kind of front-end
   processing from the computer it talks to.  The development of
   workstations and personal computers has made this term and the
   product it describes semi-obsolescent, but one may still hear
   variants of the phrase `act like a smart terminal' used to
   describe the behavior of workstations or PCs with respect to
   programs that execute almost entirely out of a remote <b><a href="#server">server</a></b>'s
   storage, using local devices as displays.  2. obs. Any terminal
   with an addressable cursor; the opposite of a <b><a href="#glass%20tty">glass tty</a></b>. 
   Today, a terminal with merely an addressable cursor, but with none
   of the more-powerful features mentioned in sense 1, is called a
   <b><a href="#dumb%20terminal">dumb terminal</a></b>.

<p>There is a classic quote from Rob Pike (inventor of the <b><a href="#blit">blit</a></b>
   terminal): "A smart terminal is not a smart<em>ass</em> terminal,
   but rather a terminal you can educate."  This illustrates a common
   design problem: The attempt to make peripherals (or anything else)
   intelligent sometimes results in finicky, rigid `special
   features' that become just so much dead weight if you try to use
   the device in any way the designer didn't anticipate.  Flexibility
   and programmability, on the other hand, are <em>really</em> smart.

   MIPS for under $5000, but didn't specify the instruction mix --
   sounds like smoke and mirrors to me."  The phrase, popularized by
   newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin c.1975, has been said to
   derive from carnie slang for magic acts and `freak show' displays
   that depend on `trompe l'oeil' effects, but also calls to mind
   the fierce Aztec god Tezcatlipoca (lit. "Smoking Mirror") for
   whom the hearts of huge numbers of human sacrificial victims were
   regularly cut out.  Upon hearing about a rigged demo or yet another
   round of fantasy-based marketing promises, hackers often feel
   analogously disheartened.  See also <b><a href="#stealth%20manager">stealth manager</a></b>.

 1. A rudimentary form of testing applied to

<p>There is an interesting semi-parallel to this term among

   by hand, a `smoke test' (hold the letter in candle smoke, then
   press it onto paper) is used to check out new dies.

<p><b>smoking clover</b> n. <p>
 [ITS] A <b><a href="#display%20hack">display hack</a></b> originally
   due to Bill Gosper.  Many convergent lines are drawn on a color
   monitor in such a way that every pixel struck has its color
   incremented.  The lines all have one endpoint in the middle of the
   screen; the other endpoints are spaced one pixel apart around the
   perimeter of a large square.  The color map is then repeatedly
   rotated.  This results in a striking, rainbow-hued, shimmering
   four-leaf clover.  Gosper joked about keeping it hidden from the
   FDA (the U.S.'s Food and Drug Administration) lest its
   hallucinogenic properties cause it to be banned.

 [MIT] A unit of length equal five
   feet seven inches.  The length of the Harvard Bridge in Boston is
   famously 364.4 smoots plus or minus an ear (the ear stands for
   <b><a href="#epsilon">epsilon</a></b>). This legend began with a fraternity prank in 1958
   during which the body length of Oliver Smoot (class of '62) was
   actually used to measure out that distance.  It is commemorated by
   smoot marks that MIT students repaint every few years; the
   tradition even survived the demolition and rebuilding of the bridge
   in the late 1980s.  The Boston police have been known to use smoot
   markers to indicate accident locations on the bridge.

<p><b>SNAFU principle</b> /sna'foo prin'si-pl/ n. <p>
 [from a WWII Army
   acronym for `Situation Normal, All Fucked Up'] "True
   communication is possible only between equals, because inferiors
   are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant
   lies than for telling the truth." -- a central tenet of
   <b><a href="#Discordianism">Discordianism</a></b>, often invoked by hackers to explain why
   authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically. 
   The effect of the SNAFU principle is a progressive disconnection of
   decision-makers from reality.  This lightly adapted version of a
   fable dating back to the early 1960s illustrates the phenomenon
   perfectly:

<blockquote>
In the beginning was the plan,<br>
       and then the specification;<br>
And the plan was without form,<br>
       and the specification was void.<br>

<p>And darkness<br>
       was on the faces of the implementors thereof;<br>
And they spake unto their leader,<br>
       saying:<br>
"It is a crock of shit,<br>
       and smells as of a sewer."<br>

<p>And the leader took pity on them,<br>
       and spoke to the project leader:<br>
"It is a crock of excrement,<br>
       and none may abide the odor thereof."<br>

<p>And the project leader<br>
       spake unto his section head, saying:<br>
"It is a container of excrement,<br>
       and it is very strong, such that none may abide it."<br>

<p>The section head then hurried to his department manager,<br>
       and informed him thus:<br>
"It is a vessel of fertilizer,<br>
       and none may abide its strength."<br>

<p>The department manager carried these words<br>
      to his general manager,<br>
and spoke unto him<br>
      saying:<br>
"It containeth that which aideth the growth of plants,<br>
      and it is very strong."<br>

<p>And so it was that the general manager rejoiced<br>
      and delivered the good news unto the Vice President.<br>
"It promoteth growth,<br>
      and it is very powerful."<br>

<p>The Vice President rushed to the President's side,<br>
      and joyously exclaimed:<br>
"This powerful new software product<br>
      will promote the growth of the company!"<br>

<p>And the President looked upon the product,<br>
      and saw that it was very good.<br>

 Paper mail, as opposed to electronic. 
   Sometimes written as the single word `SnailMail'.  One's postal
   address is, correspondingly, a `snail address'.  Derives from

   there have even been parody posters and stamps made.  Also (less

<p><b>snap</b> v. <p>
 To replace a pointer to a pointer with a direct
   pointer; to replace an old address with the forwarding address
   found there.  If you telephone the main number for an institution
   and ask for a particular person by name, the operator may tell you
   that person's extension before connecting you, in the hopes that
   you will `snap your pointer' and dial direct next time.  The
   underlying metaphor may be that of a rubber band stretched through
   a number of intermediate points; if you remove all the thumbtacks
   in the middle, it snaps into a straight line from first to last. 
   See <b><a href="#chase%20pointers">chase pointers</a></b>.

<p>Often, the behavior of a <b><a href="#trampoline">trampoline</a></b> is to perform an error
   check once and then snap the pointer that invoked it so as
   henceforth to bypass the trampoline (and its one-shot error check). 
   In this context one also speaks of `snapping links'.  For
   example, in a LISP implementation, a function interface trampoline
   might check to make sure that the caller is passing the correct
   number of arguments; if it is, and if the caller and the callee are
   both compiled, then snapping the link allows that particular path
   to use a direct procedure-call instruction with no further
   overhead.

<p>For example, owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of
   COBOL programs, a good number of them succumbed to software rot
   when their 2-digit year counters underwent <b><a href="#wrap%20around">wrap around</a></b> at the
   beginning of the year 2000.  Actually, related lossages often
   afflict centenarians who have to deal with computer software
   designed by unimaginative clods.  One such incident became the
   focus of a minor public flap in 1990, when a gentleman born in 1889
   applied for a driver's license renewal in Raleigh, North Carolina. 
   The new system refused to issue the card, probably because with
   2-digit years the ages 101 and 1 cannot be distinguished.

<p>Historical note: Software rot in an even funnier sense than the
   mythical one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g.,
   the R1; see <b><a href="#grind%20crank">grind crank</a></b>).  If a program that depended on a
   peculiar instruction hadn't been run in quite a while, the user
   might discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they
   once did.  ("Hey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do
   such-and-such.  We can <b><a href="#snarf">snarf</a></b> this opcode, right?  No one uses
   it.")

<p>Another classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker
   found a simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump
   instruction on a PDP-6, so he patched the hardware.  Unfortunately,
   this broke some fragile timing software in a music-playing program,
   throwing its output out of tune.  This was fixed by adding a
   defensive initialization routine to compare the speed of a timing
   loop with the real-time clock; in other words, it figured out how
   fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected appropriately.

   This is as opposed to object code, the derived binary executable

<p><b>space-cadet keyboard</b> n. <p>
 A now-legendary device used on MIT
   LISP machines, which inspired several still-current jargon terms
   and influenced the design of <b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b>.  It was equipped with no
   fewer than <em>seven</em> shift keys: four keys for <b><a href="#bucky%20bits">bucky bits</a></b>
   (`control', `meta', `hyper', and `super') and three
   regular shift keys, called `shift', `top', and `front'.  Many
   keys had three symbols on them: a letter and a symbol on the top,
   and a Greek letter on the front.  For example, the `L' key had an
   `L' and a two-way arrow on the top, and the Greek letter lambda on
   the front.  By pressing this key with the right hand while playing
   an appropriate `chord' with the left hand on the shift keys, you
   could get the following results:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>L
<dd>lowercase l

<dt>shift-L
<dd>uppercase L

<dt>front-L
<dd>lowercase lambda

<dt>front-shift-L
<dd>uppercase lambda

<dt>top-L
<dd>two-way arrow
(front and shift are ignored)
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course each of these might also be typed with any
   combination of the control, meta, hyper, and super keys.  On this
   keyboard, you could type over 8000 different characters!  This
   allowed the user to type very complicated mathematical text, and
   also to have thousands of single-character commands at his
   disposal.  Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the
   command meanings of that many characters if it reduced typing time
   (this attitude obviously shaped the interface of EMACS).  Other
   hackers, however, thought having that many bucky bits was overkill,
   and objected that such a keyboard can require three or four hands
   to operate.  See <b><a href="#bucky%20bits">bucky bits</a></b>, <b><a href="#cokebottle">cokebottle</a></b>, <b><a href="#double%20bucky">double bucky</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#meta%20bit">meta bit</a></b>, <b><a href="#quadruple%20bucky">quadruple bucky</a></b>.

<p>Note: early versions of this entry incorrectly identified the
   space-cadet keyboard with the `Knight keyboard'.  Though both
   were designed by Tom Knight, the latter term was properly applied
   only to a keyboard used for ITS on the PDP-10 and modeled on the
   Stanford keyboard (as described under <b><a href="#bucky%20bits">bucky bits</a></b>).  The true
   space-cadet keyboard evolved from the first Knight keyboard.

<p><b>spam</b> vt.,vi.,n. <p>
 [from "Monty Python's Flying
   Circus"] 1. To crash a program by overrunning a fixed-size buffer
   with excessively large input data.  See also <b><a href="#buffer%20overflow">buffer overflow</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#overrun%20screw">overrun screw</a></b>, <b><a href="#smash%20the%20stack">smash the stack</a></b>.  2. To cause a newsgroup
   to be flooded with irrelevant or inappropriate messages. You can
   spam a newsgroup with as little as one well- (or ill-) planned
   message (e.g. asking "What do you think of abortion?" on
   <i>soc.women</i>).  This is often done with <b><a href="#cross-post">cross-post</a></b>ing
   (e.g. any message which is cross-posted to <i>alt.rush-limbaugh</i>
   and <i>alt.politics.homosexuality</i> will almost inevitably spam
   both groups). This overlaps with <b><a href="#troll">troll</a></b> behavior; the latter
   more specific term has become more common. 3. To send many
   identical or nearly-identical messages separately to a large number
   of Usenet newsgroups. This is more specifically called `ECP',
   Excessive Cross-Posting.  This is one sure way to infuriate nearly
   everyone on the Net. See also <b><a href="#velveeta">velveeta</a></b> and <b><a href="#jello">jello</a></b>. 4. To
   bombard a newsgroup with multiple copies of a message.  This is
   more specifically called `EMP', Excessive Multi-Posting.  5.  To
   mass-mail unrequested identical or nearly-identical email messages,
   particularly those containing advertising.  Especially used when
   the mail addresses have been culled from network traffic or
   databases without the consent of the recipients. Synonyms
   include <b><a href="#UCE">UCE</a></b>, <b><a href="#UBE">UBE</a></b>. 6. Any large, annoying,
   quantity of output.  For instance, someone on IRC who walks away from
   their screen and comes back to find 200 lines of text might say "Oh no,
   spam".

<p>The later definitions have become much more prevalent as the
   Internet has opened up to non-techies, and to most people senses 3
   4 and 5 are now primary.  All three behaviors are considered abuse
   of the net, and are almost universally grounds for termination of
   the originator's email account or network connection.  In these
   senses the term `spam' has gone mainstream, though without its
   original sense or folkloric freight - there is apparently a
   widespread myth among <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b>s that "spamming" is what happens
   when you dump cans of Spam into a revolving fan.  Hormel, the
   makers of Spam, have published a surprisingly enlightened
   <a href="http://www.spam.com/ci/ci_in.htm">position statement</a> on the

 Email addresses included in, or comprising

   addresses can be people who have offended or annoyed the poster, or
   who are included so that a spammer will spam an official, thereby causing

<p><b>spamblock</b> /spam'blok/ n. <p>
 [poss. by analogy to
   sunblock] Text inserted in an email address to render it invalid
   and thus useless to spammers.  For example, the address
   `jrandom@hacker.org' might be transformed to
   `jrandom@NOSPAM.hacker.org'.  Adding spamblock to an address is
   often referred to as `munging' it (see <b><a href="#munge">munge</a></b>)-.  This evasion
   tactic depends on the fact that most spammers collect names with
   some sort of <b><a href="#address%20harvester">address harvester</a></b> on volumes too high to de-mung
   by hand, but individual humans reading an email message can readily
   spot and remove a spamblock in the From address.

<p>Note: This is not actually a very effective tactic, and may already
   be passing out of use in early 1999 after about two years of life. 
   In both mail and news, it's essentially impossible to keep a smart
   address harvester from mining out the addresses in the message
   header and trace lines.  Therefore the only people who can be
   protected are third parties mentioned by email address in the
   message - not a common enough case to interest spammers.

<p><b>spike</b> v. <p>
 1. To defeat a selection mechanism by
   introducing a (sometimes temporary) device that forces a specific
   result.  The word is used in several industries; telephone
   engineers refer to spiking a relay by inserting a pin to hold the
   relay in either the closed or open state, and railroaders refer to
   spiking a track switch so that it cannot be moved.  In programming
   environments it normally refers to a temporary change, usually for
   testing purposes (as opposed to a permanent change, which would be
   called <b><a href="#hardwired">hardwired</a></b>). 2. [borderline techspeak] A visible peak in
   an otherwise rather constant graph (e.g. a sudden surge in line
   voltage, an unexpected short "high" on a logical line in a
   circuit). Hackers frequently use this for a sudden short increase
   in some quantity such as system load or network traffic.

<p><b>stack</b> n. <p>
 The set of things a person has to do in the

   risen to the top of the stack.  "I'm afraid I've got real work to
   do, so this'll have to be pushed way down on my stack."  "I
   haven't done it yet because every time I pop my stack something new
   gets pushed."  If you are interrupted several times in the middle
   of a conversation, "My stack overflowed" means "I forget what we
   were talking about."  The implication is that more items were
   pushed onto the stack than could be remembered, so the least recent
   items were lost.  The usual physical example of a stack is to be
   found in a cafeteria: a pile of plates or trays sitting on a spring
   in a well, so that when you put one on the top they all sink down,
   and when you take one off the top the rest spring up a bit.  See
   also <b><a href="#push">push</a></b> and <b><a href="#pop">pop</a></b>.

 [University of York, England] To replace a

   accounts like adm, news, and daemon are permanently "starred

   him/her as a punishment, e.g. "Graham was starred out for playing

   means "What are you doing?" or "What are you about to do?" 
   Typical answers are "about to gronk out", or "hungry".  Another
   standard question is "What's the state of the world?", meaning
   "What's new?" or "What's going on?".  The more terse and

<p><b>strided</b> /stri:'d*d/ adj. <p>
 [scientific computing] Said of
   a sequence of memory reads and writes to addresses, each of which
   is separated from the last by a constant interval called the
   `stride length'.  These can be a worst-case access pattern for
   the standard memory-caching schemes when the stride length is a
   multiple of the cache line size.  Strided references are often
   generated by loops through an array, and (if your data is large
   enough that access-time is significant) it can be worthwhile to
   tune for better locality by inverting double loops or by partially
   unrolling the outer loop of a loop nest.  This usage is borderline
   techspeak; the related term `memory stride' is definitely
   techspeak.

<p><b>Sun</b> n. <p>
 Sun Microsystems.  Hackers remember that the name
   was originally an acronym, Stanford University Network.  Sun
   started out around 1980 with some hardware hackers (mainly) from
   Stanford talking to some software hackers (mainly) from UC
   Berkeley; Sun's original technology concept married a clever board
   design based on the Motorola 68000 to <b><a href="#BSD">BSD</a></b> Unix.  Sun went on
   to lead the workstation industry through the 1980s, and for years
   afterwards remained an engineering-driven company and a good place
   for hackers to work.  Though Sun drifted away from its techie
   origins after 1990 and has since made some strategic moves that
   disappointed and annoyed many hackers (especially by maintaining
   proprietary control of Java and rejecting Linux), it's still
   considered within the family in much the same way <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> was

   a redirect control packet, forged to look like it came from a local

<p><b>superprogrammer</b> n. <p>
 A prolific programmer; one who can code
   exceedingly well and quickly.  Not all hackers are
   superprogrammers, but many are.  (Productivity can vary from one
   programmer to another by three orders of magnitude.  For example,
   one programmer might be able to write an average of 3 lines of
   working code in one day, while another, with the proper tools,
   might be able to write 3,000.  This range is astonishing; it is
   matched in very few other areas of human endeavor.)  The term
   `superprogrammer' is more commonly used within such places as IBM
   than in the hacker community.  It tends to stress naive measures of
   productivity and to underweight creativity, ingenuity, and getting
   the job <em>done</em> -- and to sidestep the question of whether the
   3,000 lines of code do more or less useful work than three lines
   that do the <b><a href="#Right%20Thing">Right Thing</a></b>.  Hackers tend to prefer the terms

 After-sale handholding; something many software

   are useless -- because by the time a hacker calls support he or
   she will usually know the software and the relevant manuals better
   than the support people (sadly, this is <em>not</em> a joke or
   exaggeration).  A hacker's idea of `support' is a

<p>Hackers adopted this term early, but many have stopped using it
   since it went completely mainstream around 1995.  The passive,
   couch-potato connotations that go with TV channel surfing were
   never pleasant, and hearing non-hackers wax enthusiastic about
   "surfing the net" tends to make hackers feel a bit as though

<p><b>swap</b> vt. <p>
 1. [techspeak] To move information from a
   fast-access memory to a slow-access memory (`swap out'), or vice
   versa (`swap in').  Often refers specifically to the use of disks
   as `virtual memory'.  As pieces of data or program are needed,
   they are swapped into <b><a href="#core">core</a></b> for processing; when they are no
   longer needed they may be swapped out again.  2. The jargon use of
   these terms analogizes people's short-term memories with core. 
   Cramming for an exam might be spoken of as swapping in.  If you
   temporarily forget someone's name, but then remember it, your
   excuse is that it was swapped out.  To `keep something swapped
   in' means to keep it fresh in your memory: "I reread the TECO
   manual every few months to keep it swapped in."  If someone
   interrupts you just as you got a good idea, you might say "Wait a
   moment while I swap this out", implying that a piece of paper is
   your extra-somatic memory and that if you don't swap the idea out
   by writing it down it will get overwritten and lost as you talk.

<p><b>Swiss-Army chainsaw</b> <p>
 In early Unix days, a well-known
   technical paper analogized the lexical analyzer lex(1) to a
   Swiss-army knife; this was a comment on the remarkable variety of
   more general uses discovered for a program originally designed as a
   special-purpose code generator for writing compilers.  Two decades
   later, well-known hacker Henry Spencer described the <b><a href="#Perl">Perl</a></b>
   scripting language as a "Swiss-Army chainsaw", intending to
   convey his evaluation of the language as exceedingly powerful but
   ugly and noisy and prone to belch noxious fumes.  This had two
   results: (1) Perl fans adopted the epithet as a badge of pride, and
   (2) it entered more general usage to describe software that is
   highly versatile but distressingly inelegant.

<p><b>swizzle</b> v. <p>
 To convert external names, array indices, or
   references within a data structure into address pointers when the
   data structure is brought into main memory from external storage
   (also called `pointer swizzling'); this may be done for speed in
   chasing references or to simplify code (e.g., by turning lots of
   name lookups into pointer dereferences).  The converse operation is
   sometimes termed `unswizzling'.  See also <b><a href="#snap">snap</a></b>.

 (var. `synch') 1. To synchronize,
   to bring into synchronization.  2. [techspeak] To force all pending
   I/O to the disk; see <b><a href="#flush">flush</a></b>, sense 2.  3. More generally, to
   force a number of competing processes or agents to a state that
   would be `safe' if the system were to crash; thus, to checkpoint
   (in the database-theory sense).

<p><b>syntactic salt</b> n. <p>
 The opposite of <b><a href="#syntactic%20sugar">syntactic sugar</a></b>, a
   feature designed to make it harder to write bad code. 
   Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop the programmer must jump
   through just to prove that he knows what's going on, rather than to
   express a program action.  Some programmers consider required type
   declarations to be syntactic salt.  A requirement to write
   <code>end if</code>, <code>end while</code>, <code>end do</code>, etc. to terminate
   the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed to
   just <code>end</code>) would definitely be syntactic salt.  Syntactic
   salt is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers'
   blood pressures in an unhealthy way.  Compare <b><a href="#candygrammar">candygrammar</a></b>.

<p><b>syntactic sugar</b> n. <p>
 [coined by Peter Landin] Features added
   to a language or other formalism to make it `sweeter' for
   humans, but which do not affect the expressiveness of the
   formalism (compare <b><a href="#chrome">chrome</a></b>).  Used esp. when there is an
   obvious and trivial translation of the `sugar' feature into
   other constructs already present in the notation.  C's <code>a[i]</code>
   notation is syntactic sugar for <code>*(a + i)</code>.  "Syntactic sugar
   causes cancer of the semicolon." -- Alan Perlis.

<p>The variants `syntactic saccharin' and `syntactic syrup' are
   also recorded.  These denote something even more gratuitous, in
   that syntactic sugar serves a purpose (making something more
   acceptable to humans), but syntactic saccharin or syrup serve no
   purpose at all.  Compare <b><a href="#candygrammar">candygrammar</a></b>, <b><a href="#syntactic%20salt">syntactic salt</a></b>.

<p><b>T</b> /T/ <p>
 1. [from LISP terminology for `true'] Yes.  Used
   in reply to a question (particularly one asked using <b><a href="#The%20-P%20convention">The -P convention</a></b>).  In LISP, the constant T means `true', among other
   things.  Some Lisp hackers use `T' and `NIL' instead of `Yes' and
   `No' almost reflexively.  This sometimes causes misunderstandings. 
   When a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a hacker wants
   coffee, he may absently respond `T', meaning that he wants coffee;
   but of course he will be brought a cup of tea instead. 
   Fortunately, most hackers (particularly those who frequent Chinese
   restaurants) like tea at least as well as coffee -- so it is not
   that big a problem.  2. See <b><a href="#time%20T">time T</a></b> (also <b><a href="#since%20time%20T%20equals%20minus%20infinity">since time T equals minus infinity</a></b>).  3. [techspeak] In transaction-processing

<p><b>talk mode</b> n. <p>
 A feature supported by Unix, ITS, and some
   other OSes that allows two or more logged-in users to set up a
   real-time on-line conversation.  It combines the immediacy of
   talking with all the precision (and verbosity) that written
   language entails.  It is difficult to communicate inflection,
   though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section
   on writing style in the Prependices for details).

<p>Talk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing,
   which are not used orally.  Some of these are identical to (and
   probably derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs
   since the 1920s.

   some of the `social' list above; specifically, MUD respondents
   report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF, TTFN, and WTH.  The use
   of `rehi' is also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re-
   compounds and will frequently `rehug' or `rebonk' (see
   <b><a href="#bonk%2foif">bonk/oif</a></b>) people.  The word `re' by itself is taken as
   `regreet'.  In general, though, MUDders express a preference for
   typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations; this may
   be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to
   include many touch typists and to assume high-speed links.  The

<p>Some <b><a href="#B1FF">B1FF</a></b>isms (notably the variant spelling <code>d00d</code>)
   appear to be passing into wider use among some subgroups of
   MUDders.

<p>One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode,
   often seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because
   they are typing rather than speaking.  This is not the best
   approach.  It can be very frustrating to wait while your partner
   pauses to think of a word, or repeatedly makes the same spelling
   error and backs up to fix it.  It is usually best just to leave
   typographical errors behind and plunge forward, unless severe
   confusion may result; in that case it is often fastest just to type
   "xxx" and start over from before the mistake.

<p><b>TANSTAAFL</b> /tan'stah-fl/ <p>
 [acronym, from Robert Heinlein's
   classic SF novel "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress".]  "There
   Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch", often invoked when someone
   is balking at the prospect of using an unpleasantly

   database back end to get my address book program to work!" 
   "Well, TANSTAAFL you know."  This phrase owes some of its
   popularity to the high concentration of science-fiction fans and
   political libertarians in hackerdom (see <b><a href="#Appendix%20B">Appendix B</a></b> for
   discussion).

<p>Outside hacker circles the variant TINSTAAFL ("There is No Such
   Thing...") is apparently more common, and can be traced back to
   1952 in the writings of ethicist Alvin Hansen. TANSTAAFL may well have
   arisen from it by mutation.

<p><b>tar and feather</b> vi. <p>
 [from Unix <code>tar(1)</code>] To create
   a transportable archive from a group of files by first sticking
   them together with <code>tar(1)</code> (the Tape ARchiver) and then
   compressing the result (see <b><a href="#compress">compress</a></b>).  The latter action is
   dubbed `feathering' partly for euphony and (if only for contrived
   effect) by analogy to what you do with an airplane propeller to
   decrease wind resistance, or with an oar to reduce water
   resistance; smaller files, after all, slip through comm links more
   easily.  Compare the more common <b><a href="#tarball">tarball</a></b>.  Earlier, the phrase
   referred to a punishment in which the victims had tar being poured
   upon them and then, whilst the tar was still sticky, having a
   pillow full of feathers - or other material - thrown at them.  See

<p><b>taste</b> [primarily MIT] n. <p>
 1. The quality in a program that
   tends to be inversely proportional to the number of features,
   hacks, and kluges programmed into it.  Also `tasty',
   `tasteful', `tastefulness'.  "This feature comes in N
   tasty flavors."  Although `tasty' and `flavorful' are
   essentially synonyms, `taste' and <b><a href="#flavor">flavor</a></b> are not.  Taste
   refers to sound judgment on the part of the creator; a program or
   feature can <em>exhibit</em> taste but cannot <em>have</em> taste.  On
   the other hand, a feature can have <b><a href="#flavor">flavor</a></b>.  Also, <b><a href="#flavor">flavor</a></b>
   has the additional meaning of `kind' or `variety' not shared by
   `taste'.  The marked sense of <b><a href="#flavor">flavor</a></b> is more popular than

<p><b>TCP/IP</b> /T'C-P I'P/ n. <p>
 1. [Transmission Control
   Protocol/Internet Protocol] The wide-area-networking protocol that
   makes the Internet work, and the only one most hackers can speak
   the name of without laughing or retching.  Unlike such allegedly
   `standard' competitors such as X.25, DECnet, and the ISO 7-layer
   stack, TCP/IP evolved primarily by actually being <em>used</em>,
   rather than being handed down from on high by a vendor or a
   heavily-politicized standards committee.  Consequently, it (a)
   works, (b) actually promotes cheap cross-platform connectivity, and
   (c) annoys the hell out of corporate and governmental
   empire-builders everywhere.  Hackers value all three of these
   properties. See <b><a href="#creationism">creationism</a></b>.  2.  [Amateur Packet Radio]
   Formerly expanded as "The Crap Phil Is Pushing".  The reference
   is to Phil Karn, KA9Q, and the context was an ongoing
   technical/political war between the majority of sites still running
   AX.25 and the TCP/IP relays. TCP/IP won.

<p><b>TECO</b> /tee'koh/ n.,v. obs. <p>
 1. [originally an acronym for
   `[paper] Tape Editor and COrrector'; later, `Text Editor and
   COrrector'] n. A text editor developed at MIT and modified by just
   about everybody.  With all the dialects included, TECO may have
   been the most prolific editor in use before <b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b>, to which it
   was directly ancestral.  Noted for its powerful
   programming-language-like features and its unspeakably hairy
   syntax.  It is literally the case that every string of characters
   is a valid TECO program (though probably not a useful one); one
   common game used to be mentally working out what the TECO commands
   corresponding to human names did.  2. vt. Originally, to edit using
   the TECO editor in one of its infinite variations (see below). 
   3. vt.,obs.  To edit even when TECO is <em>not</em> the editor being
   used!  This usage is rare and now primarily historical.

<p>As an example of TECO's obscurity, here is a TECO program that
   takes a list of names such as:

<pre>Loser, J. Random
Quux, The Great
Dick, Moby
</pre>

<p>sorts them alphabetically according to surname, and then puts the
   surname last, removing the comma, to produce the following:

<pre>Moby Dick
J. Random Loser
The Great Quux
</pre>

<p>The program is

<pre>[1 J^P$L$$
J &lt;.-Z; .,(S,$ -D .)FX1 @F^B $K :L I $ G1 L&gt;$$
</pre>

<p>(where ^B means `Control-B' (ASCII 0000010) and $ is actually
   an <b><a href="#alt">alt</a></b> or escape (ASCII 0011011) character).

<p>In fact, this very program was used to produce the second, sorted
   list from the first list.  The first hack at it had a <b><a href="#bug">bug</a></b>: GLS
   (the author) had accidentally omitted the <code>@</code> in front
   of <code>F^B</code>, which as anyone can see is clearly the <b><a href="#Wrong%20Thing">Wrong Thing</a></b>.  It
   worked fine the second time.  There is no space to describe all the
   features of TECO, but it may be of interest that <code>^P</code> means
   `sort' and <code>J&lt;.-Z; <small>...</small> L&gt;</code> is an idiomatic series of commands
   for `do once for every line'.

<p>In mid-1991, TECO is pretty much one with the dust of history,
   having been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by <b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b>. 
   Descendants of an early (and somewhat lobotomized) version adopted
   by DEC can still be found lurking on VMS and a couple of crufty
   PDP-11 operating systems, however, and ports of the more advanced
   MIT versions remain the focus of some antiquarian interest.  See
   also <b><a href="#retrocomputing">retrocomputing</a></b>, <b><a href="#write-only%20language">write-only language</a></b>.

 [Caltech, ca. 1979] Any
   malfunctioning computer terminal.  A common failure mode of
   Lear-Siegler ADM 3a terminals caused the `L' key to produce the `K'
   code instead; complaints about this tended to look like "Terminak
   #3 has a bad keyboard.  Pkease fix."

   MacLISP)] To output a <b><a href="#newline">newline</a></b>.  Now rare as jargon, though
   still used as techspeak in Common LISP.  It is a contraction of
   `TERminate PRInt line', named for the fact that, on some early OSes
   and hardware, no characters would be printed until a complete line
   was formed, so this operation terminated the line and emitted the

<p><b>TeX</b> /tekh/ n. <p>

<p>An extremely powerful <b><a href="#macro">macro</a></b>-based text formatter written by
   Donald E. <b><a href="#Knuth">Knuth</a></b>, very popular in the computer-science
   community (it is good enough to have displaced Unix <b><a href="#troff">troff</a></b>, the
   other favored formatter, even at many Unix installations).  TeX
   fans insist on the correct (guttural) pronunciation, and the
   correct spelling (all caps, squished together, with the E depressed
   below the baseline; the mixed-case `TeX' is considered an
   acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices).  Fans like to proliferate
   names from the word `TeX' -- such as TeXnician (TeX
   user), TeXhacker (TeX programmer), TeXmaster (competent
   TeX programmer), TeXhax, and TeXnique.  See also
   <b><a href="#CrApTeX">CrApTeX</a></b>.

<p>Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining
   quality of the typesetting in volumes I-III of his monumental
   "Art of Computer Programming" (see <b><a href="#Knuth">Knuth</a></b>, also
   <b><a href="#bible">bible</a></b>).  In a manifestation of the typical hackish urge to
   solve the problem at hand once and for all, he began to design his
   own typesetting language.  He thought he would finish it on his
   sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8 years.  The
   language was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of "The
   Art of Computer Programming" is not expected to appear until 2002. 
   The impact and influence of TeX's design has been such that
   nobody minds this very much.  Many grand hackish projects have
   started as a bit of <b><a href="#toolsmith">toolsmith</a></b>ing on the way to something else;
   Knuth's diversion was simply on a grander scale than most.

<p>TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but
   high-quality software.  Knuth offers a monetary awards to anyone
   who found and reported bugs dating from before the 1989 code
   freeze; as the years wore on and the few remaining bugs were fixed
   (and new ones even harder to find), the bribe went up.  Though
   well-written, TeX is so large (and so full of cutting edge
   technique) that it is said to have unearthed at least one bug in
   every Pascal system it has been compiled with.

<p><b>the network</b> n. <p>
 1. Historically, the union of all the major
   noncommercial, academic, and hacker-oriented networks, such as
   Internet, the pre-1990 ARPANET, NSFnet, <b><a href="#BITNET">BITNET</a></b>, and the
   virtual UUCP and <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b> `networks', plus the corporate
   in-house networks and commercial time-sharing services (such as
   CompuServe, GEnie and AOL) that gateway to them.  A site is
   generally considered `on the network' if it can be reached
   through some combination of Internet-style (@-sign) and UUCP
   (bang-path) addresses.  See <b><a href="#Internet">Internet</a></b>, <b><a href="#bang%20path">bang path</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#Internet%20address">Internet address</a></b>, <b><a href="#network%20address">network address</a></b>.  2. Following the
   mass-culture discovery of the Internet in 1994 and subsequent
   proliferation of cheap TCP/IP connections, "the network" is
   increasingly synonymous with the Internet itself (as it was before
   the second wave of wide-area computer networking began around 1980). 
   3. A fictional conspiracy of libertarian hacker-subversives and
   anti-authoritarian monkeywrenchers described in Robert Anton
   Wilson's novel "Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat", to which many hackers
   have subsequently decided they belong (this is an example of <b><a href="#ha%20ha%20only%20serious">ha ha only serious</a></b>).

<p>In sense 1, `the network' is often abbreviated to `the net'.  "Are
   you on the net?" is a frequent question when hackers first meet
   face to face, and "See you on the net!" is a frequent goodbye.

<p><b>thundering herd problem</b> <p>
 Scheduler thrashing.  This can
   happen under Unix when you have a number of processes that are
   waiting on a single event. When that event (a connection to the web
   server, say) happens, every process which could possibly handle the
   event is awakened.  In the end, only one of those processes will
   actually be able to do the work, but, in the meantime, all the
   others wake up and contend for CPU time before being put back to
   sleep. Thus the system thrashes briefly while a herd of processes
   thunders through. If this starts to happen many times per second,
   the performance impact can be significant.

<p><b>thunk</b> /thuhnk/ n. <p>
 1. [obs.]"A piece of coding
   which provides an address", according to P. Z. Ingerman, who
   invented thunks in 1961 as a way of binding actual parameters to
   their formal definitions in Algol-60 procedure calls.  If a
   procedure is called with an expression in the place of a formal
   parameter, the compiler generates a thunk which computes the
   expression and leaves the address of the result in some standard
   location.  2. Later generalized into: an expression, frozen
   together with its environment, for later evaluation if and when
   needed (similar to what in techspeak is called a `closure'). 
   The process of unfreezing these thunks is called `forcing'. 
   3. A <b><a href="#stubroutine">stubroutine</a></b>, in an overlay programming environment, that
   loads and jumps to the correct overlay.  Compare <b><a href="#trampoline">trampoline</a></b>. 
   4. People and activities scheduled in a thunklike manner.  "It
   occurred to me the other day that I am rather accurately modeled by
   a thunk -- I frequently need to be forced to completion." -
   paraphrased from a <b><a href="#plan%20file">plan file</a></b>.

<p>Historical note: There are a couple of onomatopoeic myths
   circulating about the origin of this term.  The most common is that
   it is the sound made by data hitting the stack; another holds that
   the sound is that of the data hitting an accumulator.  Yet another
   suggests that it is the sound of the expression being unfrozen at
   argument-evaluation time.  In fact, according to the inventors, it
   was coined after they realized (in the wee hours after hours of
   discussion) that the type of an argument in Algol-60 could be
   figured out in advance with a little compile-time thought,
   simplifying the evaluation machinery.  In other words, it had
   `already been thought of'; thus it was christened a `thunk',
   which is "the past tense of `think' at two in the morning".

 [Acorn Computers] Features in
   software or hardware that customers insist on but never use

   equivalent would be `checklist features', but this jargon sense
   of the phrase has not been reported.

<p><b>tiger team</b> n. <p>
 [U.S. military jargon] 1. Originally, a team
   (of <b><a href="#sneaker">sneaker</a></b>s) whose purpose is to penetrate security, and thus
   test security measures.  These people are paid professionals who do
   hacker-type tricks, e.g., leave cardboard signs saying "bomb" in
   critical defense installations, hand-lettered notes saying "Your
   codebooks have been stolen" (they usually haven't been) inside
   safes, etc.  After a successful penetration, some high-ranking
   security type shows up the next morning for a `security review'
   and finds the sign, note, etc., and all hell breaks loose.  Serious
   successes of tiger teams sometimes lead to early retirement for
   base commanders and security officers (see the <b><a href="#patch">patch</a></b> entry for
   an example).  2. Recently, and more generally, any official
   inspection team or special <b><a href="#firefighting">firefighting</a></b> group called in to
   look at a problem.

<p>A subset of tiger teams are professional <b><a href="#cracker">cracker</a></b>s, testing the
   security of military computer installations by attempting remote
   attacks via networks or supposedly `secure' comm channels.  Some of
   their escapades, if declassified, would probably rank among the
   greatest hacks of all times.  The term has been adopted in
   commercial computer-security circles in this more specific sense.

<p><b>time bomb</b> n. <p>
 A subspecies of <b><a href="#logic%20bomb">logic bomb</a></b> that is
   triggered by reaching some preset time, either once or
   periodically.  There are numerous legends about time bombs set up
   by programmers in their employers' machines, to go off if the
   programmer is fired or laid off and is not present to perform the
   appropriate suppressing action periodically.

<p>Interestingly, the only such incident for which we have been
   pointed to documentary evidence took place in the Soviet Union in
   1986!  A disgruntled programmer at the Volga Automobile Plant
   (where the Fiat clones called Ladas were manufactured) planted a
   time bomb which, a week after he'd left on vacation, stopped the
   entire main assembly line for a day.  The case attracted lots of
   attention in the Soviet Union because it was the first cracking
   case to make it to court there.  The perpetrator got a suspended
   sentence of 3 years in jail and was barred from future work as a
   programmer.

<p><b>time T</b> /ti:m T/ n. <p>
 1. An unspecified but usually
   well-understood time, often used in conjunction with a later time
   T+1.  "We'll meet on campus at time T or at Louie's
   at time T+1" means, in the context of going out for dinner:
   "We can meet on campus and go to Louie's, or we can meet at
   Louie's itself a bit later."  (Louie's was a Chinese restaurant in
   Palo Alto that was a favorite with hackers.)  Had the number 30
   been used instead of the number 1, it would have implied that the
   travel time from campus to Louie's is 30 minutes; whatever time
   T is (and that hasn't been decided on yet), you can meet
   half an hour later at Louie's than you could on campus and end up
   eating at the same time.  See also <b><a href="#since%20time%20T%20equals%20minus%20infinity">since time T equals minus infinity</a></b>.

<p><b>TLA</b> /T-L-A/ n. <p>
 [Three-Letter Acronym]
   1. Self-describing abbreviation for a species with which computing
   terminology is infested.  2. Any confusing acronym.  Examples
   include MCA, FTP, SNA, CPU, MMU, SCCS, DMU, FPU, NNTP, TLA. 
   People who like this looser usage argue that not all TLAs have
   three letters, just as not all four-letter words have four letters. 
   One also hears of `ETLA' (Extended Three-Letter Acronym,
   pronounced /ee tee el ay/) being used to describe four-letter
   acronyms; the terms `SFLA' (Stupid Four-Letter Acronym),
   `LFLA' (Longer Four Letter Acronym), and VLFLA (Very Long Five
   Letter Acronym) have also been reported.  See also <b><a href="#YABA">YABA</a></b>.

<p>The self-effacing phrase "TDM TLA" (Too Damn Many<small>...</small>) is
   often used to bemoan the plethora of TLAs in use.  In 1989, a
   random of the journalistic persuasion asked hacker Paul Boutin
   "What do you think will be the biggest problem in computing in
   the 90s?"  Paul's straight-faced response: "There are only
   17,000 three-letter acronyms." (To be exact, there are 26^3
   = 17,576.)  There is probably some karmic justice in the fact that
   Paul Boutin subsequently became a journalist.

<p><b>TMRC</b> /tmerk'/ n. <p>
 The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one
   of the wellsprings of hacker culture.  The 1959 "Dictionary of
   the TMRC Language" compiled by Peter Samson included several terms
   that became basics of the hackish vocabulary (see esp. <b><a href="#foo">foo</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#mung">mung</a></b>, and <b><a href="#frob">frob</a></b>).

<p>By 1962, TMRC's legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity
   and has grown in the years since. All the features described here
   were still present when the old layout was decomissioned in 1998
   just before the demolition of MIT Building 20, and will almost
   certainly be retained when the old layout is rebuilt (expected in
   2003).  The control system alone featured about 1200 relays.  There
   were <b><a href="#scram%20switch">scram switch</a></b>es located at numerous places around the room
   that could be thwacked if something undesirable was about to occur,
   such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction.  Another feature
   of the system was a digital clock on the dispatch board, which was
   itself something of a wonder in those bygone days before cheap LEDs
   and seven-segment displays.  When someone hit a scram switch the
   clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word `FOO'; at
   TMRC the scram switches are therefore called `foo switches'.

<p>Steven Levy, in his book "Hackers" (see the
   <b><a href="#Bibliography">Bibliography</a></b> in Appendix C), gives a stimulating account of
   those early years.  TMRC's Signals and Power Committee included
   many of the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who later became the
   core of the MIT AI Lab staff.  Thirty years later that connection
   is still very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly includes a
   number of entries from a recent revision of the TMRC dictionary.

<p>TMRC has a web page at <a href="http://tmrc-www.mit.edu">http://tmrc-www.mit.edu</a>.  The TMRC
   Dictionary is available there, at

<p><b>to a first approximation</b> adj. <p>
 1. [techspeak] When one is doing

   computed by any of several heuristic methods, then refined to a
   final value.  By using the starting point of a first approximation
   of the answer, one can write an algorithm that converges more
   quickly to the correct result.  2. In jargon, a preface to any
   comment that indicates that the comment is only approximately true. 
   The remark "To a first approximation, I feel good" might indicate
   that deeper questioning would reveal that not all is perfect (e.g.,
   a nagging cough still remains after an illness).

 To change a <b><a href="#bit">bit</a></b> from whatever state it is

   comes from `toggle switches', such as standard light switches,

   keeps the switch in the position to which it is flipped rather than
   to the fact that the switch has two positions.  There are four
   things you can do to a bit: set it (force it to be 1), clear (or
   zero) it, leave it alone, or toggle it.  (Mathematically, one would
   say that there are four distinct boolean-valued functions of one
   boolean argument, but saying that is much less fun than talking

<p><b>toolchain</b> <p>
 A collection of tools used to develop for a

   format (thus `the Crusoe development toolchain', or the `DocBook
   toolchain'). Often used in the context of building software on one
   system which will be installed or run on some other device; in that
   case the chain of tools usually consists of such items as a
   particular version of a compiler, libraries, special headers, etc. 
   May also be used of text-formatting, page layout, or multimedia
   tools which render from some markup to a variety of production
   formats.  Differs from `toolkit' in that the former implies a
   collection of semi-independent tools with complementary functions,
   while `toolchain' implies that each of the parts is a serial stage
   in a rather tightly bound pipeline.  Seems to have become current
   in early 1999 and 2000; now common.

<p><b>topic drift</b> n. <p>
 Term used on GEnie, Usenet and other
   electronic fora to describe the tendency of a <b><a href="#thread">thread</a></b> to drift
   away from the original subject of discussion (and thus, from the
   Subject header of the originating message), or the results of that
   tendency.  The header in each post can be changed to keep current
   with the posts, but usually isn't due to forgetfulness or laziness. 
   A single post may often result in several posts each responding to
   a different point in the original.  Some subthreads will actually
   be in response to some off-the-cuff side comment, possibly
   degenerating into a <b><a href="#flame%20war">flame war</a></b>, or just as often evolving into a
   separate discussion.  Hence, discussions aren't really so much
   threads as they are trees.  Except that they don't really have
   leaves, or multiple branching roots; usually some lines of
   discussion will just sort of die off after everyone gets tired of
   them.  This could take anywhere from hours to weeks, or even
   longer.

<p>The term `topic drift' is often used in gentle reminders that
   the discussion has strayed off any useful track.  "I think we
   started with a question about Niven's last book, but we've ended up
   discussing the sexual habits of the common marmoset.  Now
   <em>that's</em> topic drift!"

 Information in an on-line display
   that is not immediately useful, but contributes to a viewer's
   gestalt of what's going on with the software or hardware behind it. 
   Whether a given piece of info falls in this category depends partly
   on what the user is looking for at any given time.  The `bytes
   free' information at the bottom of an MS-DOS <code>dir</code> display is
   tourist information; so (most of the time) is the TIME information
   in a Unix <code>ps(1)</code> display.

 An incredibly <b><a href="#hairy">hairy</a></b> technique, found
   in some <b><a href="#HLL">HLL</a></b> and program-overlay implementations (e.g., on the
   Macintosh), that involves on-the-fly generation of small executable

   between code sections.  Under BSD and possibly in other Unixes,
   trampoline code is used to transfer control from the kernel back to
   user mode when a signal (which has had a handler installed) is sent
   to a process.  These pieces of <b><a href="#live%20data">live data</a></b> are called
   `trampolines'.  Trampolines are notoriously difficult to

<p><b>trap</b> <p>
 1. n. A program interrupt, usually an interrupt caused
   by some exceptional situation in the user program.  In most cases,
   the OS performs some action, then returns control to the program. 
   2. vi. To cause a trap.  "These instructions trap to the
   monitor."  Also used transitively to indicate the cause of the
   trap.  "The monitor traps all input/output instructions."

<p>This term is associated with assembler programming (`interrupt'
   or `exception' is more common among <b><a href="#HLL">HLL</a></b> programmers) and
   appears to be fading into history among programmers as the role of
   assembler continues to shrink.  However, it is still important to
   computer architects and systems hackers (see <b><a href="#system">system</a></b>,
   sense 1), who use it to distinguish deterministically repeatable
   exceptions from timing-dependent ones (such as I/O interrupts).

<p><b>troff</b> /T'rof/ or /trof/ n. <p>
 <p>
 [Unix] The gray
   eminence of Unix text processing; a formatting and phototypesetting
   program, written originally in PDP-11 assembler and then in
   barely-structured early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after
   the earlier ROFF which was in turn modeled after the <b><a href="#Multics">Multics</a></b> and
   <b><a href="#CTSS">CTSS</a></b> program RUNOFF by Jerome Saltzer (<em>that</em> name came from
   the expression "to run off a copy").  A companion program,
   <b><a href="#nroff">nroff</a></b>, formats output for terminals and line printers.

<p>In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive
   phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT.  His paper
   describing that work ("A Typesetter-independent troff," AT&amp;T CSTR
   #97) explains troff's durability.  After discussing the program's
   "obvious deficiencies -- a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious
   and undocumented properties in some areas, and a voracious appetite
   for computer resources" and noting the ugliness and extreme
   hairiness of the code and internals, Kernighan concludes:

<blockquote>
None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating
Ossanna's accomplishment with TROFF.  It has proven a
remarkably robust tool, taking unbelievable abuse from a
variety of preprocessors and being forced into uses that
were never conceived of in the original design, all with
considerable grace under fire. 
</blockquote>

<p>The success of <b><a href="#TeX">TeX</a></b> and desktop publishing systems have
   reduced <code>troff</code>'s relative importance, but this tribute
   perfectly captures the strengths that secured <code>troff</code> a place
   in hacker folklore; indeed, it could be taken more generally as an
   indication of those qualities of good programs that, in the long
   run, hackers most admire.

<p><b>troll</b> <p>
 1. v.,n. [From the Usenet group
   <i>alt.folklore.urban</i>] To utter a posting on <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b>
   designed to attract predictable responses or <b><a href="#flame">flame</a></b>s; or, the
   post itself.  Derives from the phrase "trolling for <b><a href="#newbie">newbie</a></b>s"
   which in turn comes from mainstream "trolling", a style of
   fishing in which one trails bait through a likely spot hoping for a
   bite.  The well-constructed troll is a post that induces lots of
   newbies and flamers to make themselves look even more clueless than
   they already do, while subtly conveying to the more savvy and
   experienced that it is in fact a deliberate troll.  If you don't
   fall for the joke, you get to be in on it. See also <b><a href="#YHBT">YHBT</a></b>. 2. 
   n. An individual who chronically trolls in sense 1; regularly posts
   specious arguments, flames or personal attacks to a newsgroup,
   discussion list, or in email for no other purpose than to annoy
   someone or disrupt a discussion.  Trolls are recognizable by the
   fact that they have no real interest in learning about the topic at
   hand - they simply want to utter flame bait.  Like the ugly
   creatures they are named after, they exhibit no redeeming
   characteristics, and as such, they are recognized as a lower form
   of life on the net, as in, "Oh, ignore him, he's just a troll." 
   Compare <b><a href="#kook">kook</a></b>.  3. n. [Berkeley] Computer lab monitor. A popular
   campus job for CS students. Duties include helping newbies and
   ensuring that lab policies are followed. Probably so-called because
   it involves lurking in dark cavelike corners.

<p>Some people claim that the troll (sense 1) is properly a narrower category
   than <b><a href="#flame%20bait">flame bait</a></b>, that a troll is categorized by containing
   some assertion that is wrong but not overtly controversial. See
   also <b><a href="#Troll-O-Meter">Troll-O-Meter</a></b>.

<p>The use of `troll' in either sense is a live metaphor that readily
   produces elaborations and combining forms.  For example, one not
   infrequently sees the warning "Do not feed the troll" as part
   of a followup to troll postings.

   un-tron yourself".  One may also speak of `tron mode'; compare

<p>Note that many dialects of BASIC have a TRON/TROFF
   command pair that enables/disables line number tracing; this has
   no obvious relationship to the slang usage.

<p><b>tty</b> /T-T-Y/, /tit'ee/ n. <p>
 The latter pronunciation was
   primarily ITS, but some Unix people say it this way as well; this
   pronunciation is <em>not</em> considered to have sexual
   undertones. 1. A terminal of the teletype variety, characterized by
   a noisy mechanical printer, a very limited character set, and poor
   print quality.  Usage: antiquated (like the TTYs themselves).  See
   also <b><a href="#bit-paired%20keyboard">bit-paired keyboard</a></b>.  2. [especially Unix] Any terminal
   at all; sometimes used to refer to the particular terminal
   controlling a given job.  3. [Unix] Any serial port, whether or not
   the device connected to it is a terminal; so called because under
   Unix such devices have names of the form tty*.  Ambiguity between
   senses 2 and 3 is common but seldom bothersome.

<p><b>tunafish</b> n. <p>
 In hackish lore, refers to the mutated
   punchline of an age-old joke to be found at the bottom of the
   manual pages of <code>tunefs(8)</code> in the original <b><a href="#BSD">BSD</a></b> 4.2
   distribution.  The joke was removed in later releases once
   commercial sites started using 4.2, but apparently restored on the
   4.4BSD tape and in {Net,Free,Open}BSD.  Tunefs relates to the
   `tuning' of file-system parameters for optimum performance, and
   at the bottom of a few pages of wizardly inscriptions was a `BUGS'
   section consisting of the line "You can tune a file system, but
   you can't tunafish".  Variants of this can be seen in other BSD
   versions, though it has been excised from some versions by
   humorless management <b><a href="#droid">droid</a></b>s.  The [nt]roff source for SunOS
   4.1.1 contains a comment apparently designed to prevent this:
   "Take this out and a Unix Demon will dog your steps from now until

<p><b>Turing tar-pit</b> n. <p>
 1. A place where anything is possible but
   nothing of interest is practical.  Alan Turing helped lay the
   foundations of computer science by showing that all machines and
   languages capable of expressing a certain very primitive set of
   operations are logically equivalent in the kinds of computations
   they can carry out, and in principle have capabilities that differ
   only in speed from those of the most powerful and elegantly
   designed computers.  However, no machine or language exactly
   matching Turing's primitive set has ever been built (other than
   possibly as a classroom exercise), because it would be horribly
   slow and far too painful to use.  A `Turing tar-pit' is any
   computer language or other tool that shares this property.  That
   is, it's theoretically universal -- but in practice, the harder
   you struggle to get any real work done, the deeper its inadequacies
   suck you in.  Compare <b><a href="#bondage-and-discipline%20language">bondage-and-discipline language</a></b>.  2. The
   perennial <b><a href="#holy%20wars">holy wars</a></b> over whether language A or B is the "most
   powerful".

<p><b>Tux</b> <p>
 Tux the Penguin is the official emblem of <b><a href="#Linux">Linux</a></b>,
   This eventuated after a logo contest in 1996, during which Linus
   Torvalds endorsed the idea of a penguin logo in a couple of
   famously funny <a href="http://www.woodsoup.org/~sbaker/tux/doc/">postings</a>.  Linus explained that he was once bitten by a killer
   penguin in Australia and has felt a special affinity for the
   species ever since.  (Linus has since admitted that he was also
   thinking of Feathers McGraw, the evil-genius penguin jewel thief
   who appeared in a Wallace &amp; Grommit feature cartoon, "The
   Wrong Trousers".)

<p>Larry Ewing <a href="http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/">designed</a>
   the official Tux logo.  It has proved a wise choice, amenable to
   hundreds of recognizable variations used as emblems of
   Linux-related projects, products, and user groups. In fact, Tux has
   spawned an entire mythology, of which the
   <a href="http://www.ao.com/~regan/penguins/tux.html">Gospel According to Tux</a> and the mock-epic poem "Tuxowolf" are among the
   best-known examples.

<p>There is a `real' Tux - a black-footed penguin resident at the
   Bristol Zoo.  Several friends of Linux bought a zoo sponsorship
   for Linus as a birthday present in 1996.

<p><b>TWENEX</b> /twe'neks/ n. <p>
 The TOPS-20 operating system by <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b>
   -- the second proprietary OS for the PDP-10 -- preferred by most
   PDP-10 hackers over TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not
   <b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b> or <b><a href="#WAITS">WAITS</a></b> partisans).  TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt,
   Beranek &amp; Newman's TENEX operating system using special paging
   hardware.  By the early 1970s, almost all of the systems on the
   ARPANET ran TENEX.  DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and
   began work to make it their own.  The first in-house code name for
   the operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System);
   when customers started asking questions, the name was changed to
   SNARK so DEC could truthfully deny that there was any project
   called VIROS.  When the name SNARK became known, the name was
   briefly reversed to become KRANS; this was quickly abandoned when
   someone objected that `krans' meant `funeral wreath' in Swedish
   (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply
   `wreath'; this part of the story may be apocryphal).  Ultimately
   DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it was
   as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The hacker community, mindful of
   its origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of `twenty
   TENEX'), even though by this point very little of the original
   TENEX code remained (analogously to the differences between AT&amp;T V6
   Unix and BSD).  DEC people cringed when they heard "TWENEX", but
   the term caught on nevertheless (the written abbreviation `20x'
   was also used).  TWENEX was successful and very popular; in fact,
   there was a period in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent
   a culture of partisans as Unix or ITS -- but DEC's decision to
   scrap all the internal rivals to the VAX architecture and its
   relatively stodgy VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to
   TWENEX's brief day in the sun.  DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20
   users to convert to <b><a href="#VMS">VMS</a></b>, but instead, by the late 1980s, most
   of the TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix.

   3. vt. To change something in a small way.  Bits, for example, are

<p><b>twirling baton</b> n. <p>
 [PLATO] The overstrike sequence -/|\-/|\-
   which produces an animated twirling baton.  If you output it with a
   single backspace between characters, the baton spins in place.  If
   you output the sequence BS SP between characters, the baton spins
   from left to right.  If you output BS SP BS BS between characters,
   the baton spins from right to left.  This is also occasionally
   called a twiddle prompt.

<p>The twirling baton was a popular component of animated signature
   files on the pioneering PLATO educational timesharing system.  The
   <code>archie</code> Internet service is perhaps the best-known baton
   program today; it uses the twirling baton as an idler indicating
   that the program is working on a query.  The twirling baton is also
   used as a boot progress indicator on several BSD variants of Unix;
   if it stops, you're probably going to have a long and trying day.

<p><b>Unix</b> /yoo'niks/ n. <p>
 [In the authors' words, "A weak
   pun on Multics"; very early on it was `UNICS'] (also `UNIX') An
   interactive time-sharing system invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson
   after Bell Labs left the Multics project, originally so he could
   play games on his scavenged PDP-7.  Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of
   C, is considered a co-author of the system.  The turning point in
   Unix's history came when it was reimplemented almost entirely in C
   during 1972-1974, making it the first source-portable OS.  Unix
   subsequently underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of
   many different people, resulting in a uniquely flexible and
   developer-friendly environment.  By 1991, Unix had become the most
   widely used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world
   - and since 1996 the variant called <b><a href="#Linux">Linux</a></b> has been at the
   cutting edge of the <b><a href="#open%20source">open source</a></b> movement.  Many people
   consider the success of Unix the most important victory yet of
   hackerdom over industry opposition (but see <b><a href="#Unix%20weenie">Unix weenie</a></b> and
   <b><a href="#Unix%20conspiracy">Unix conspiracy</a></b> for an opposing point of view).  See
   <b><a href="#Version%207">Version 7</a></b>, <b><a href="#BSD">BSD</a></b>, <b><a href="#Linux">Linux</a></b>.

<p>Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately
   `UNIX' or `Unix'; both forms are common, and used interchangeably. 
   Dennis Ritchie says that the `UNIX' spelling originally happened in
   CACM's 1974 paper "The UNIX Time-Sharing System" because "we
   had a new typesetter and <b><a href="#troff">troff</a></b> had just been invented and we
   were intoxicated by being able to produce small caps."  Later, dmr
   tried to get the spelling changed to `Unix' in a couple of Bell
   Labs papers, on the grounds that the word is not acronymic.  He
   failed, and eventually (his words) "wimped out" on the issue. 
   So, while the trademark today is `UNIX', both capitalizations are
   grounded in ancient usage; the Jargon File uses `Unix' in deference
   to dmr's wishes.

<p><b>Unix brain damage</b> n. <p>
 Something that has to be done to break
   a network program (typically a mailer) on a non-Unix system so that
   it will interoperate with Unix systems.  The hack may qualify as
   `Unix brain damage' if the program conforms to published
   standards and the Unix program in question does not.  Unix brain
   damage happens because it is much easier for other (minority)
   systems to change their ways to match non-conforming behavior than
   it is to change all the hundreds of thousands of Unix systems out
   there.

<p>An example of Unix brain damage is a <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b> in a mail server to
   recognize bare line feed (the Unix newline) as an equivalent form
   to the Internet standard newline, which is a carriage return
   followed by a line feed.  Such things can make even a hardened

<p><b>Unix conspiracy</b> n. <p>
 [ITS] According to a conspiracy theory
   long popular among <b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b> and <b><a href="#TOPS-20">TOPS-20</a></b> fans, Unix's growth is
   the result of a plot, hatched during the 1970s at Bell Labs, whose
   intent was to hobble AT&amp;T's competitors by making them dependent
   upon a system whose future evolution was to be under AT&amp;T's
   control.  This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating
   system that is apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also
   relatively unreliable and insecure (so as to require continuing
   upgrades from AT&amp;T).  This theory was lent a substantial impetus in
   1984 by the paper referenced in the <b><a href="#back%20door">back door</a></b> entry.

<p>In this view, Unix was designed to be one of the first computer
   viruses (see <b><a href="#virus">virus</a></b>) -- but a virus spread to computers
   indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly
   through disks and networks.  Adherents of this `Unix virus' theory
   like to cite the fact that the well-known quotation "Unix is snake
   oil" was uttered by <b><a href="#DEC">DEC</a></b> president Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC
   began actively promoting its own family of Unix workstations. 
   (Olsen now claims to have been misquoted.)

<p>[If there was ever such a conspiracy, it got thoroughly out of the
   plotters' control after 1990.  AT&amp;T sold its Unix operation to
   Novell around the same time <b><a href="#Linux">Linux</a></b> and other free-Unix
   distributions were beginning to make noise. --ESR]

<p><b>Unix weenie</b> n. <p>
 [ITS] 1. A derogatory play on `Unix wizard',
   common among hackers who use Unix by necessity but would prefer
   alternatives.  The implication is that although the person in
   question may consider mastery of Unix arcana to be a wizardly
   skill, the only real skill involved is the ability to tolerate (and
   the bad taste to wallow in) the incoherence and needless complexity
   that is alleged to infest many Unix programs.  "This shell script
   tries to parse its arguments in 69 bletcherous ways.  It must have

   system supported mainly by Unix machines.  Originally implemented
   in 1979-1980 by Steve Bellovin, Jim Ellis, Tom Truscott, and Steve
   Daniel at Duke University, it has swiftly grown to become
   international in scope and is now probably the largest
   decentralized information utility in existence.  As of early 1996,
   it hosts over 10,000 <b><a href="#newsgroup">newsgroup</a></b>s and an average of over 500
   megabytes (the equivalent of several thousand paper pages) of new

<p>By the year the Internet hit the mainstream (1994) the original

<p><b>user</b> n. <p>
 1. Someone doing `real work' with the computer,

   anything you tell him.  One who asks silly questions.  [GLS
   observes: This is slightly unfair.  It is true that users ask
   questions (of necessity).  Sometimes they are thoughtful or deep. 
   Very often they are annoying or downright stupid, apparently
   because the user failed to think for two seconds or look in the
   documentation before bothering the maintainer.]  See <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b>. 
   3. Someone who uses a program from the outside, however skillfully,
   without getting into the internals of the program.  One who reports
   bugs instead of just going ahead and fixing them.

<p>The general theory behind this term is that there are two classes
   of people who work with a program: there are implementors (hackers)
   and <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b>s.  The users are looked down on by hackers to some
   extent because they don't understand the full ramifications of the
   system in all its glory.  (The few users who do are known as
   `real winners'.)  The term is a relative one: a skilled hacker
   may be a user with respect to some program he himself does not
   hack.  A LISP hacker might be one who maintains LISP or one who
   uses LISP (but with the skill of a hacker).  A LISP user is one who
   uses LISP, whether skillfully or not.  Thus there is some overlap
   between the two terms; the subtle distinctions must be resolved by
   context.

<p>Once upon a time in <b><a href="#elder%20days">elder days</a></b>, everyone running Unix had

<p><b>UUOC</b> <p>
 [from the comp.unix.shell group on Usenet] Stands for
   `Useless Use of <b><a href="#cat">cat</a></b>'; the reference is to the Unix command
   cat(1), not the feline animal. As received wisdom on
   comp.unix.shell observes, "The purpose of cat is to concatenate
   (or `catenate') files. If it's only one file, concatenating it with
   nothing at all is a waste of time, and costs you a process." 
   Nevertheless one sees people doing

<pre>cat file | some_command and its args ...
</pre>


<br><p>
<p>instead of the equivalent and cheaper

<pre>&lt;file some_command and its args ...
</pre>


<br><p>
<p>or (equivalently and more classically)

<pre>some_command and its args ... &lt;file
</pre>


<br><p>
<p>Since 1995, occasional awards for UUOC have been given out, usually
   by Perl luminary  Randal L. Schwartz.  There is a
   <a href="http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~reriksso/unix/award.html">web page</a> devoted to this and other similar awards.

<p><b>vadding</b> /vad'ing/ n. <p>
 [from VAD, a permutation of ADV
   (i.e., <b><a href="#ADVENT">ADVENT</a></b>), used to avoid a particular <b><a href="#admin">admin</a></b>'s
   continual search-and-destroy sweeps for the game] A leisure-time
   activity of certain hackers involving the covert exploration of the
   `secret' parts of large buildings -- basements, roofs, freight
   elevators, maintenance crawlways, steam tunnels, and the like.  A
   few go so far as to learn locksmithing in order to synthesize
   vadding keys.  The verb is `to vad' (compare <b><a href="#phreaking">phreaking</a></b>; see
   also <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b>, sense 9).  This term dates from the late 1970s,
   before which such activity was simply called `hacking'; the older
   usage is still prevalent at MIT.

<p>The most extreme and dangerous form of vadding is `elevator
   rodeo', a.k.a. `elevator surfing', a sport played by wrasslin'
   down a thousand-pound elevator car with a 3-foot piece of
   string, and then exploiting this mastery in various stimulating
   ways (such as elevator hopping, shaft exploration, rat-racing, and
   the ever-popular drop experiments).  Kids, don't try this at home!

<p><b>vanilla</b> adj. <p>
 [from the default flavor of ice cream in the
   U.S.]  Ordinary <b><a href="#flavor">flavor</a></b>, standard.  When used of food, very
   often does not mean that the food is flavored with vanilla extract! 
   For example, `vanilla wonton soup' means ordinary wonton soup, as
   opposed to hot-and-sour wonton soup.  Applied to hardware and
   software, as in "Vanilla Version 7 Unix can't run on a vanilla
   11/34."  Also used to orthogonalize chip nomenclature; for
   instance, a 74V00 means what TI calls a 7400, as distinct from a
   74LS00, etc.  This word differs from <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b> in that the
   latter means `default', whereas vanilla simply means
   `ordinary'.  For example, when hackers go on a <b><a href="#great-wall">great-wall</a></b>,
   hot-and-sour soup is the <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b> soup to get (because that
   is what most of them usually order) even though it isn't the
   vanilla (wonton) soup.

<p><b>vannevar</b> /van'*-var/ n. <p>
 A bogus technological prediction
   or a foredoomed engineering concept, esp. one that fails by
   implicitly assuming that technologies develop linearly,
   incrementally, and in isolation from one another when in fact the
   learning curve tends to be highly nonlinear, revolutions are
   common, and competition is the rule.  The prototype was Vannevar
   Bush's prediction of `electronic brains' the size of the Empire
   State Building with a Niagara-Falls-equivalent cooling system for
   their tubes and relays, a prediction made at a time when the
   semiconductor effect had already been demonstrated.  Other famous
   vannevars have included magnetic-bubble memory, LISP machines,
   <b><a href="#videotex">videotex</a></b>, and a paper from the late 1970s that computed a
   purported ultimate limit on areal density for ICs that was in fact

<p><b>VAX</b> /vaks/ n. <p>
 1. [from Virtual Address eXtension] The
   most successful minicomputer design in industry history, possibly
   excepting its immediate ancestor, the PDP-11.  Between its release
   in 1978 and its eclipse by <b><a href="#killer%20micro">killer micro</a></b>s after about 1986, the
   VAX was probably the hacker's favorite machine of them all, esp. 
   after the 1982 release of 4.2 BSD Unix (see <b><a href="#BSD">BSD</a></b>).  Esp. 
   noted for its large, assembler-programmer-friendly instruction set
   -- an asset that became a liability after the RISC revolution. 
   2. A major brand of vacuum cleaner in Britain.  Cited here because
   its sales pitch, "Nothing sucks like a VAX!" became a sort of
   battle-cry of RISC partisans.  It is even sometimes claimed that
   DEC actually entered a cross-licensing deal with the vacuum-Vax
   people that allowed them to market VAX computers in the U.K. in
   return for not challenging the vacuum cleaner trademark in the
   U.S.

<p>A rival brand actually pioneered the slogan: its original form was
   "Nothing sucks like Electrolux".  It has apparently become a classic
   example (used in advertising textbooks) of the perils of not knowing
   the local idiom.  But in 1996, the press manager of Electrolux AB,
   while confirming that the company used this slogan in the late 1960s,
   also tells us that their marketing people were fully aware of the
   possible double entendre and intended it to gain attention.

<p>And gain attention it did - the VAX-vacuum-cleaner people thought
   the slogan a sufficiently good idea to copy it.  Several British
   hackers report that VAX's promotions used it in 1986-1987, and we
   have one report from a New Zealander that the infamous slogan
   surfaced there in TV ads for the product in 1992.

<p><b>vaxocentrism</b> /vak`soh-sen'trizm/ n. <p>
 [analogy with
   `ethnocentrism'] A notional disease said to afflict C programmers
   who persist in coding according to certain assumptions that are
   valid (esp. under Unix) on <b><a href="#VAXen">VAXen</a></b> but false elsewhere. Among
   these are:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>The assumption that dereferencing a null pointer is safe because it
is all bits 0, and location 0 is readable and 0.  Problem: this may
instead cause an illegal-address trap on non-VAXen, and even on
VAXen under OSes other than BSD Unix.  Usually this is an implicit
assumption of sloppy code (forgetting to check the pointer before
using it), rather than deliberate exploitation of a
misfeature.

<li>The assumption that characters are signed.

<li>The assumption that a pointer to any one type can freely be cast
into a pointer to any other type.  A stronger form of this is the
assumption that all pointers are the same size and format, which
means you don't have to worry about getting the casts or types
correct in calls.  Problem: this fails on word-oriented machines
or others with multiple pointer formats.

<li>The assumption that the parameters of a routine are stored in
memory, on a stack, contiguously, and in strictly ascending or
descending order.  Problem: this fails on many RISC architectures.

<li>The assumption that pointer and integer types are the same size,
and that pointers can be stuffed into integer variables (and
vice-versa) and drawn back out without being truncated or mangled. 
Problem: this fails on segmented architectures or word-oriented
machines with funny pointer formats.

<li>The assumption that a data type of any size may begin at any byte
address in memory (for example, that you can freely construct and
dereference a pointer to a word- or greater-sized object at an odd
char address).  Problem: this fails on many (esp. RISC)
architectures better optimized for <b><a href="#HLL">HLL</a></b> execution speed, and
can cause an illegal address fault or bus error.

<li>The (related) assumption that there is no padding at the end of
types and that in an array you can thus step right from the last
byte of a previous component to the first byte of the next one. 
This is not only machine- but compiler-dependent.

<li>The assumption that memory address space is globally flat and that
the array reference <code>foo[-1]</code> is necessarily valid.  Problem:
this fails at 0, or other places on segment-addressed machines like
Intel chips (yes, segmentation is universally considered a
<b><a href="#brain-damaged">brain-damaged</a></b> way to design machines (see <b><a href="#moby">moby</a></b>), but that
is a separate issue).

<li>The assumption that objects can be arbitrarily large with no
special considerations.  Problem: this fails on segmented
architectures and under non-virtual-addressing environments.

<li>The assumption that the stack can be as large as memory.  Problem:
this fails on segmented architectures or almost anything else
without virtual addressing and a paged stack.

<li>The assumption that bits and addressable units within an object
are ordered in the same way and that this order is a constant of
nature.  Problem: this fails on <b><a href="#big-endian">big-endian</a></b> machines.

<li>The assumption that it is meaningful to compare pointers to
different objects not located within the same array, or to objects
of different types.  Problem: the former fails on segmented
architectures, the latter on word-oriented machines or others with
multiple pointer formats.

<li>The assumption that an <code>int</code> is 32 bits, or (nearly
equivalently) the assumption that <code>sizeof(int) ==
sizeof(long)</code>.  Problem: this fails on PDP-11s, 286-based systems and
even on 386 and 68000 systems under some compilers (and on 64-bit
   systems like the Alpha, of course).

<li>The assumption that <code>argv[]</code> is writable.  Problem: this fails
in many embedded-systems C environments and even under a few flavors
of Unix.
</ol>

<p>Note that a programmer can validly be accused of vaxocentrism
   even if he or she has never seen a VAX.  Some of these assumptions
   (esp. 2-5) were valid on the PDP-11, the original C machine, and
   became endemic years before the VAX.  The terms `vaxocentricity'
   and `all-the-world's-a-VAX syndrome' have been used synonymously.

<p><b>vdiff</b> /vee'dif/ v.,n. <p>
 Visual diff.  The operation of
   finding differences between two files by <b><a href="#eyeball%20search">eyeball search</a></b>.  The
   term `optical diff' has also been reported, and is sometimes more
   specifically used for the act of superimposing two nearly identical
   printouts on one another and holding them up to a light to spot
   differences.  Though this method is poor for detecting omissions in
   the `rear' file, it can also be used with printouts of graphics, a
   claim few if any diff programs can make.  See <b><a href="#diff">diff</a></b>.

<p>An interesting variant of the vdiff technique usable by anyone who
   has sufficient control over the parallax of their eyeballs
   (e.g. those who can easily view random-dot stereograms), is to hold
   up two paper printouts and go cross-eyed to superimpose them.  This
   invokes deep, fast, built-in image comparison wetware (the same
   machinery responsible for depth perception) and differences stand
   out almost immediately.  This technique is good for finding edits
   in graphical images, or for comparing an image with a compressed
   version to spot artifacts.

 The first widely

   in 1978.  The term is used adjectivally to describe Unix features
   and programs that date from that release, and are thus guaranteed
   to be present and portable in all Unix versions (this was the
   standard gauge of portability before the POSIX and IEEE 1003
   standards).  Note that this usage does <em>not</em> derive from the
   release being the "seventh version of <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b>"; research
   <b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b> at Bell Labs has traditionally been numbered according to
   the edition of the associated documentation.  Indeed, only the
   widely-distributed Sixth and Seventh Editions are widely known as
   V[67]; the OS that might today be known as `V10' is instead known

<p><b>vi</b> /V-I/, <em>not</em> /vi:/ and <em>never</em> /siks/ n. 
   <p>
 [from `Visual Interface'] A screen editor crufted together by
   Bill Joy for an early <b><a href="#BSD">BSD</a></b> release.  Became the <i>de facto</i>
   standard Unix editor and a nearly undisputed hacker favorite
   outside of MIT until the rise of <b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b> after about 1984. 
   Tends to frustrate new users no end, as it will neither take
   commands while expecting input text nor vice versa, and the default
   setup on older versions provides no indication of which mode the
   editor is in (years ago, a correspondent reported that he has often
   heard the editor's name pronounced /vi:l/; there is now a vi
   clone named `vile').  Nevertheless vi (and variants such as vim
   and elvis) is still widely used (about half the respondents in a
   1991 Usenet poll preferred it), and even EMACS fans often resort to
   it as a mail editor and for small editing jobs (mainly because it
   starts up faster than the bulkier versions of EMACS).  See

<p><b>videotex</b> n. obs. <p>
 An electronic service offering people the
   privilege of paying to read the weather on their television screens
   instead of having somebody read it to them for free while they
   brush their teeth.  The idea bombed everywhere it wasn't
   government-subsidized, because by the time videotex was practical
   the installed base of personal computers could hook up to
   timesharing services and do the things for which videotex might
   have been worthwhile better and cheaper.  Videotex planners badly
   overestimated both the appeal of getting information from a
   computer and the cost of local intelligence at the user's end.

   For example, the U.S. holiday Thanksgiving is always on a Thursday. 
   The next day is often also a holiday or taken as an extra day off,
   in which case Wednesday of that week is a virtual Friday (and
   Thursday is a virtual Saturday, as is Friday).  There are also
   `virtual Mondays' that are actually Tuesdays, after the three-day

 1. Computer simulations that use 3-D

   network interaction incorporating aspects of role-playing games,

   confessions' magazines.  In a virtual reality forum (such as
   Usenet's <i>alt.callahans</i> newsgroup or the <b><a href="#MUD">MUD</a></b> experiments on
   Internet), interaction between the participants is written like a
   shared novel complete with scenery, `foreground characters' that
   may be personae utterly unlike the people who write them, and
   common `background characters' manipulable by all parties.  The

<p><b>virus</b> n. <p>
 [from the obvious analogy with biological viruses,
   via SF] A cracker program that searches out other programs and
   `infects' them by embedding a copy of itself in them, so that
   they become <b><a href="#Trojan%20horse">Trojan horse</a></b>s.  When these programs are executed,
   the embedded virus is executed too, thus propagating the
   `infection'.  This normally happens invisibly to the user. 
   Unlike a <b><a href="#worm">worm</a></b>, a virus cannot infect other computers without
   assistance.  It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading
   programs with their friends (see <b><a href="#SEX">SEX</a></b>).  The virus may do
   nothing but propagate itself and then allow the program to run
   normally.  Usually, however, after propagating silently for a
   while, it starts doing things like writing cute messages on the
   terminal or playing strange tricks with the display (some viruses
   include nice <b><a href="#display%20hack">display hack</a></b>s).  Many nasty viruses, written by
   particularly perversely minded <b><a href="#cracker">cracker</a></b>s, do irreversible
   damage, like nuking all the user's files.

<p>In the 1990s, viruses became a serious problem, especially among
   Windows users; the lack of security on these machines enables
   viruses to spread easily, even infecting the operating system (Unix
   machines, by contrast, are immune to such attacks).  The production
   of special anti-virus software has become an industry, and a number
   of exaggerated media reports have caused outbreaks of near hysteria
   among users; many <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b>s tend to blame <em>everything</em> that
   doesn't work as they had expected on virus attacks.  Accordingly,
   this sense of `virus' has passed not only into techspeak but into
   also popular usage (where it is often incorrectly used to denote a
   <b><a href="#worm">worm</a></b> or even a <b><a href="#Trojan%20horse">Trojan horse</a></b>).  See <b><a href="#phage">phage</a></b>; compare

 1. One who hacks vision, in the sense of an
   Artificial Intelligence researcher working on the problem of
   getting computers to `see' things using TV cameras.  (There
   isn't any problem in sending information from a TV camera to a
   computer.  The problem is, how can the computer be programmed to
   make use of the camera information?  See <b><a href="#SMOP">SMOP</a></b>,

<p><b>W2K bug</b> <p>
 [from `Y2K bug' for the Year 2000 problem] The
   deployment of Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system, which
   hackers generally expect will turn out to have been among the worst
   train wrecks in the history of software engineering.  Such is the
   power of Microsoft marketing, however, that it is also expected
   this will not become obvious until it has incurred hundreds of
   millions of dollars in downtime and lost opportunity costs.

<p><b>wabbit</b> /wab'it/ n. <p>
 [almost certainly from Elmer Fudd's
   immortal line "You wascawwy wabbit!"] 1. A legendary early hack
   reported on a System/360 at RPI and elsewhere around 1978; this may
   have descended (if only by inspiration) from a hack called RABBITS
   reported from 1969 on a Burroughs 5500 at the University of
   Washington Computer Center.  The program would make two copies of
   itself every time it was run, eventually crashing the system. 
   2. By extension, any hack that includes infinite self-replication

<p><b>WAITS</b> /wayts/ n. <p>
 The mutant cousin of <b><a href="#TOPS-10">TOPS-10</a></b> used
   on a handful of systems at <b><a href="#SAIL">SAIL</a></b> up to 1990.  There was never
   an `official' expansion of WAITS (the name itself having been
   arrived at by a rather sideways process), but it was frequently
   glossed as `West-coast Alternative to ITS'.  Though WAITS was less
   visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and ideas
   between the two communities, and innovations pioneered at WAITS
   exerted enormous indirect influence.  The early screen modes of
   <b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b>, for example, were directly inspired by WAITS's `E'
   editor -- one of a family of editors that were the first to do
   `real-time editing', in which the editing commands were invisible
   and where one typed text at the point of insertion/overwriting. 
   The modern style of multi-region windowing is said to have
   originated there, and WAITS alumni at XEROX PARC and elsewhere
   played major roles in the developments that led to the XEROX Star,
   the Macintosh, and the Sun workstations.  Also invented there were
   <b><a href="#bucky%20bits">bucky bits</a></b> -- thus, the ALT key on every IBM PC is a WAITS
   legacy.  One WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was
   a news-wire interface that allowed WAITS hackers to read, store,
   and filter AP and UPI dispatches from their terminals; the system
   also featured a still-unusual level of support for what is now
   called `multimedia' computing, allowing analog audio and video
   signals to be switched to programming terminals.

<p><b>waldo</b> /wol'doh/ n. <p>
 [From Robert A. Heinlein's story
   "Waldo"] 1. A mechanical agent, such as a gripper arm,

<p><b>walking drives</b> n. <p>
 An occasional failure mode of

   <b><a href="#washing%20machine">washing machine</a></b>s.  Those old <b><a href="#dinosaur">dinosaur</a></b> parts carried
   terrific angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned spindle
   or worn bearings and stick-slip interactions with the floor could
   cause them to `walk' across a room, lurching alternate corners
   forward a couple of millimeters at a time.  There is a legend about
   a drive that walked over to the only door to the computer room and
   jammed it shut; the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in order to
   get at it!  Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of
   drive access (a fast seek across the whole width of the disk,
   followed by a slow seek in the other direction).  Some bands of
   old-time hackers figured out how to induce disk-accessing patterns
   that would do this to particular drive models and held disk-drive
   races.

<p><b>wall</b> interj. <p>
 [WPI] 1. An indication of confusion, usually spoken
   with a quizzical tone: "Wall??"  2. A request for further
   explication.  Compare <b><a href="#octal%20forty">octal forty</a></b>.  3. [Unix, from `write
   all'] v. To send a message to everyone currently logged in,
   esp. with the wall(8) utility.

<p>It is said that sense 1 came from the idiom `like talking to a
   blank wall'.  It was originally used in situations where, after you
   had carefully answered a question, the questioner stared at you
   blankly, clearly having understood nothing that was explained.  You
   would then throw out a "Hello, wall?" to elicit some sort of
   response from the questioner.  Later, confused questioners began
   voicing "Wall?" themselves.

<p><b>wall follower</b> n. <p>
 A person or algorithm that compensates for
   lack of sophistication or native stupidity by efficiently following
   some simple procedure shown to have been effective in the past. 
   Used of an algorithm, this is not necessarily pejorative; it
   recalls `Harvey Wallbanger', the winning robot in an early AI
   contest (named, of course, after the cocktail).  Harvey
   successfully solved mazes by keeping a `finger' on one wall and
   running till it came out the other end.  This was inelegant, but it
   was mathematically guaranteed to work on simply-connected mazes --
   and, in fact, Harvey outperformed more sophisticated robots that
   tried to `learn' each maze by building an internal
   representation of it.  Used of humans, the term <em>is</em>
   pejorative and implies an uncreative, bureaucratic, by-the-book
   mentality.  See also <b><a href="#code%20grinder">code grinder</a></b>; compare <b><a href="#droid">droid</a></b>.

<p><b>wall wart</b> n. <p>
 A small power-supply brick with integral
   male plug, designed to plug directly into a wall outlet; called a
   `wart' because when installed on a power strip it tends to block up
   at least one more socket than it uses.  These are frequently
   associated with modems and other small electronic devices which
   would become unacceptably bulky or hot if they had power supplies
   on board (there are other reasons as well having to do with the
   cost of UL certification).

<p><b>wallpaper</b> n. <p>
 1. A file containing a listing (e.g., assembly
   listing) or a transcript, esp. a file containing a transcript of
   all or part of a login session.  (The idea was that the paper for
   such listings was essentially good only for wallpaper, as evidenced
   at Stanford, where it was used to cover windows.)  Now rare, esp. 
   since other systems have developed other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO
   on TWENEX).  However, the Unix world doesn't have an equivalent
   term, so perhaps <b><a href="#wallpaper">wallpaper</a></b> will take hold there.  The term
   probably originated on ITS, where the commands to begin and end
   transcript files were <code>:WALBEG</code> and <code>:WALEND</code>, with
   default file <code>WALL PAPER</code> (the space was a path delimiter). 
   2. The background pattern used on graphical workstations (this is
   techspeak under the `Windows' graphical user interface to
   MS-DOS).  3. `wallpaper file' n. The file that contains the
   wallpaper information before it is actually printed on paper. 
   (Even if you don't intend ever to produce a real paper copy of the
   file, it is still called a wallpaper file.)

<p><b>wank</b> /wangk/ n.,v.,adj. <p>
 [Columbia University: prob. by
   mutation from Commonwealth slang v. `wank', to masturbate] Used
   much as <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b> is elsewhere, as a noun denoting a clever
   technique or person or the result of such cleverness.  May describe
   (negatively) the act of hacking for hacking's sake ("Quit wanking,
   let's go get supper!") or (more positively) a <b><a href="#wizard">wizard</a></b>.  Adj. 
   `wanky' describes something particularly clever (a person,
   program, or algorithm).  Conversations can also get wanky when
   there are too many wanks involved.  This excess wankiness is
   signalled by an overload of the `wankometer' (compare
   <b><a href="#bogometer">bogometer</a></b>).  When the wankometer overloads, the conversation's
   subject must be changed, or all non-wanks will leave.  Compare
   `neep-neeping' (under <b><a href="#neep-neep">neep-neep</a></b>).  Usage: U.S. only.  In
   Britain and the Commonwealth this word is <em>extremely</em> rude and
   is best avoided unless one intends to give offense.  Adjectival
   `wanky' is less offensive and simply means `stupid' or `broken'
   (this is mainstream in Great Britain).

<p><b>wannabee</b> /won'*-bee/ n. <p>
 (also, more plausibly, spelled
   `wannabe') [from a term recently used to describe Madonna fans
   who dress, talk, and act like their idol; prob. originally from
   biker slang] A would-be <b><a href="#hacker">hacker</a></b>.  The connotations of this term
   differ sharply depending on the age and exposure of the subject. 
   Used of a person who is in or might be entering <b><a href="#larval%20stage">larval stage</a></b>,
   it is semi-approving; such wannabees can be annoying but most
   hackers remember that they, too, were once such creatures.  When
   used of any professional programmer, CS academic, writer, or
   <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>, it is derogatory, implying that said person is trying to
   cuddle up to the hacker mystique but doesn't, fundamentally, have a
   prayer of understanding what it is all about.  Overuse of terms
   from this lexicon is often an indication of the <b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b>
   nature.  Compare <b><a href="#newbie">newbie</a></b>.

<p>Historical note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different
   flavor now (1993) than it did ten or fifteen years ago.  When the
   people who are now hackerdom's tribal elders were in <b><a href="#larval%20stage">larval stage</a></b>, the process of becoming a hacker was largely unconscious
   and unaffected by models known in popular culture -- communities
   formed spontaneously around people who, <em>as individuals</em>, felt
   irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, and what wannabees
   experienced was a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to become
   similarly wizardly.  Those days of innocence are gone forever;
   society's adaptation to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980
   included the elevation of the hacker as a new kind of folk hero,
   and the result is that some people semi-consciously set out to
   <em>be hackers</em> and borrow hackish prestige by fitting the
   popular image of hackers.  Fortunately, to do this really well, one
   has to actually become a wizard.  Nevertheless, old-time hackers
   tend to share a poorly articulated disquiet about the change; among
   other things, it gives them mixed feelings about the effects of
   public compendia of lore like this one.

 A substantial subculture of
   <b><a href="#cracker">cracker</a></b>s refer to themselves as `warez d00dz'; there is
   evidently some connection with <b><a href="#B1FF">B1FF</a></b> here.  As `Ozone Pilot',
   one former warez d00d, wrote:

<blockquote>
Warez d00dz get illegal copies of copyrighted software.  If
it has copy protection on it, they break the protection so
the software can be copied.  Then they distribute it around
the world via several gateways.  Warez d00dz form badass
group names like RAZOR and the like.  They put up boards
that distribute the latest ware, or pirate program.  The
whole point of the Warez sub-culture is to get the pirate
program released and distributed before any other group.  I
know, I know.  But don't ask, and it won't hurt as much. 
This is how they prove their poweress [sic].  It gives them
the right to say, "I released King's Quest IVXIX before you
so obviously my testicles are larger." Again don't ask... 
</blockquote>

<p>The studly thing to do if one is a warez d00d, it appears, is emit
   `0-day warez', that is copies of commercial software copied and
   cracked on the same day as its retail release.  Warez d00ds also
   hoard software in a big way, collecting untold megabytes of
   arcade-style games, pornographic JPGs, and applications they'll
   never use onto their hard disks.  As Ozone Pilot acutely observes:

<blockquote>
[BELONG] is the only word you will need to know.  Warez d00dz want to
belong.  They have been shunned by everyone, and thus turn to
cyberspace for acceptance.  That is why they always start groups like
TGW, FLT, USA and the like.  Structure makes them happy. [...] 
Warez d00dz will never have a handle like "Pink Daisy" because warez
d00dz are insecure.  Only someone who is very secure with a good dose
of self-esteem can stand up to the cries of fag and girlie-man.  More
likely you will find warez d00dz with handles like:  Doctor Death,
Deranged Lunatic, Hellraiser, Mad Prince, Dreamdevil, The Unknown,
Renegade Chemist, Terminator, and Twin Turbo.  They like to sound
badass when they can hide behind their terminals.  More likely, if
you were given a sample of 100 people, the person whose handle is
Hellraiser is the last person you'd associate with the name.

<p><b>washing machine</b> n. <p>
 1. Old-style 14-inch hard disks in
   floor-standing cabinets.  So called because of the size of the
   cabinet and the `top-loading' access to the media packs -- and, of
   course, they were always set on `spin cycle'.  The
   washing-machine idiom transcends language barriers; it is even used
   in Russian hacker jargon.  See also <b><a href="#walking%20drives">walking drives</a></b>.  The thick
   channel cables connecting these were called `bit hoses' (see

<p><b>wedged</b> adj. <p>
 1. To be stuck, incapable of proceeding
   without help.  This is different from having crashed.  If the
   system has crashed, it has become totally non-functioning.  If the
   system is wedged, it is trying to do something but cannot make
   progress; it may be capable of doing a few things, but not be fully
   operational.  For example, a process may become wedged if it
   <b><a href="#deadlock">deadlock</a></b>s with another (but not all instances of wedging are
   deadlocks).  See also <b><a href="#gronk">gronk</a></b>, <b><a href="#locked%20up">locked up</a></b>, <b><a href="#hosed">hosed</a></b>,
   <b><a href="#hung">hung</a></b> (wedged is more severe than <b><a href="#hung">hung</a></b>).  2. Often refers
   to humans suffering misconceptions.  "He's totally wedged -- he's
   convinced that he can levitate through meditation."  3. [Unix]
   Specifically used to describe the state of a TTY left in a losing
   state by abort of a screen-oriented program or one that has messed
   with the line discipline in some obscure way.

<p>There is some dispute over the origin of this term.  It is usually
   thought to derive from a common description of recto-cranial
   inversion; however, it may actually have originated with older
   `hot-press' printing technology in which physical type elements
   were locked into type frames with wedges driven in by mallets. 
   Once this had been done, no changes in the typesetting for that
   page could be made.

 [coined in a paper by T.H. Myer
   and I.E. Sutherland "On the Design of Display Processors", Comm. 
   ACM, Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used to refer to a well-known
   effect whereby function in a computing system family is migrated
   out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed, then the
   peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its job,
   then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two
   asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function
   back into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again.

<p>Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in
   graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in
   communications and floating-point processors.  Also known as `the
   Wheel of Life', `the Wheel of Samsara', and other variations of

<p><b>wiggles</b> n. <p>
 [scientific computation] In solving partial
   differential equations by finite difference and similar methods,
   wiggles are sawtooth (up-down-up-down) oscillations at the shortest
   wavelength representable on the grid.  If an algorithm is unstable,
   this is often the most unstable waveform, so it grows to dominate
   the solution.  Alternatively, stable (though inaccurate) wiggles
   can be generated near a discontinuity by a Gibbs phenomenon.

<p><b>Winchester</b> n. <p>
 Informal generic term for
   sealed-enclosure magnetic-disk drives in which the read-write head
   planes over the disk surface on an air cushion.  There is a legend
   that the name arose because the original 1973 engineering prototype
   for what later became the IBM 3340 featured two 30-megabyte
   volumes; 30-30 became `Winchester' when somebody noticed the
   similarity to the common term for a famous Winchester rifle (in the
   latter, the first 30 referred to caliber and the second to the
   grain weight of the charge).  (It is sometimes incorrectly claimed
   that Winchester was the laboratory in which the technology was
   developed.)

<p><b>woofer</b> n. <p>
 [University of Waterloo] Some varieties of wide
   paper for printers have a perforation 8.5 inches from the left
   margin that allows the excess on the right-hand side to be torn off
   when the print format is 80 columns or less wide.  The right-hand
   excess may be called `woofer'.  This term (like <b><a href="#tweeter">tweeter</a></b>) has
   been in use at Waterloo since 1972, but is elsewhere unknown.  In
   audio jargon, the word refers to the bass speaker(s) on a hi-fi.

   tables'.  2. [Amateur Packet Radio] A network path using a
   commercial satellite link to join two or more amateur VHF networks. 
   So called because traffic routed through a wormhole leaves and

 The obvious antonym to
   `read-only memory'.  Out of frustration with the long and
   seemingly useless chain of approvals required of component
   specifications, during which no actual checking seemed to occur, an
   engineer at Signetics once created a specification for a write-only
   memory and included it with a bunch of other specifications to be
   approved.  This inclusion came to the attention of Signetics
   <b><a href="#management">management</a></b> only when regular customers started calling and
   asking for pricing information.  Signetics published a corrected
   edition of the data book and requested the return of the
   `erroneous' ones.  Later, in 1972, Signetics bought a
   double-page spread in "Electronics" magazine's April issue and
   used the spec as an April Fools' Day joke.  Instead of the more
   conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 "fully encoded, 9046
   x N, Random Access, write-only-memory" data sheet included
   diagrams of "bit capacity vs. Temp.", "Iff vs. Vff", "Number
   of pins remaining vs. number of socket insertions", and "AQL
   vs. selling price".  The 25120 required a 6.3 VAC VFF supply, a
   +10V VCC, and VDD of 0V, +/- 2%.

<p><b>wumpus</b> /wuhm'p*s/ n. <p>
 The central monster (and, in many
   versions, the name) of a famous family of very early computer games
   called "Hunt The Wumpus'.  The original was invented in 1970 (several
   years before <b><a href="#ADVENT">ADVENT</a></b>) by Gregory Yob. 
   The wumpus lived somewhere in a cave with the topology of an
   dodecahedron's edge/vertex graph (later versions supported other
   topologies, including an icosahedron and M&ouml;bius strip). The
   player started somewhere at random in the cave with five `crooked
   arrows'; these could be shot through up to three connected rooms,
   and would kill the wumpus on a hit (later versions introduced the
   wounded wumpus, which got very angry).  Unfortunately for players,
   the movement necessary to map the maze was made hazardous not
   merely by the wumpus (which would eat you if you stepped on him)
   but also by bottomless pits and colonies of super bats that would
   pick you up and drop you at a random location (later versions added
   `anaerobic termites' that ate arrows, bat migrations, and
   earthquakes that randomly changed pit locations).

<p>This game appears to have been the first to use a non-random
   graph-structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like the
   even older Star Trek games).  In this respect, as in the
   dungeon-like setting and its terse, amusing messages, it prefigured
   <b><a href="#ADVENT">ADVENT</a></b> and <b><a href="#Zork">Zork</a></b> and was directly ancestral to the latter
   (Zork acknowledged this heritage by including a super-bat colony). 
   A C emulation of the original Basic game is available at the
   Retrocomputing Museum, <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/retro">http://www.tuxedo.org/retro</a>.

<p><b>WYSIAYG</b> /wiz'ee-ayg/ adj. <p>
 Describes a user interface
   under which "What You See Is <em>All</em> You Get"; an unhappy
   variant of <b><a href="#WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a></b>.  Visual, `point-and-shoot'-style
   interfaces tend to have easy initial learning curves, but also to
   lack depth; they often frustrate advanced users who would be better
   served by a command-style interface.  When this happens, the
   frustrated user has a WYSIAYG problem.  This term is most often
   used of editors, word processors, and document formatting programs. 
   WYSIWYG `desktop publishing' programs, for example, are a clear
   win for creating small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in
   them, especially things like newsletters and presentation slides. 
   When typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale
   changes the nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG
   limitations, and the increased power and flexibility of a
   command-driven formatter like <b><a href="#TeX">TeX</a></b> or Unix's <b><a href="#troff">troff</a></b>

 The famed Palo Alto
   Research Center.  For more than a decade, from the early 1970s into
   the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an astonishing volume of groundbreaking
   hardware and software innovations.  The modern mice, windows, and
   icons style of software interface was invented there.  So was the
   laser printer and the local-area network; and PARC's series of D
   machines anticipated the powerful personal computers of the 1980s
   by a decade.  Sadly, the prophets at PARC were without honor in
   their own company, so much so that it became a standard joke to

 [from the ADVENT game] The <b><a href="#canonical">canonical</a></b> `magic
   word'.  This comes from <b><a href="#ADVENT">ADVENT</a></b>, in which the idea is to
   explore an underground cave with many rooms and to collect the
   treasures you find there.  If you type `xyzzy' at the appropriate
   time, you can move instantly between two otherwise distant points. 
   If, therefore, you encounter some bit of <b><a href="#magic">magic</a></b>, you might
   remark on this quite succinctly by saying simply "Xyzzy!" 
   "Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has
   protected it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will
   let you do it anyway."  "Xyzzy!"  It's traditional for xyzzy
   to be an <b><a href="#Easter%20egg">Easter egg</a></b> in games with text interfaces.

<p>Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op
   command on several OSes; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it
   would typically respond "Nothing happens", just as <b><a href="#ADVENT">ADVENT</a></b>
   did if the magic was invoked at the wrong spot or before a player
   had performed the action that enabled the word.  In more recent
   32-bit versions, by the way, AOS/VS responds "Twice as much
   happens".

<p>Early versions of the popular `minesweeper' game under Microsoft
   Windows had a cheat mode triggered by the command
   `xyzzy&lt;enter&gt;&lt;right-shift&gt;' that turns the top-left pixel of the
   screen different colors depending on whether or not the cursor is
   over a bomb.  This feature temporarily diasappeared in Windows 98,
   but reappeared in Windows 2000.

<p>The following passage from "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" by
   L. Frank Baum, suggesting a possible pre-ADVENT origin, has
   recently come to light:

<p>"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said Dorothy, who was now standing on both
   feet.  This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great
   chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys
   flew up to them.

<p>The text can be viewed at <a href="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext93/wizoz10.txt">Project Gutenberg</a>.

<p>Another possible pre-ADVENT origin is discussed at

 [Cambridge] Yet Another Bloody Acronym. 
   Whenever some program is being named, someone invariably suggests
   that it be given a name that is acronymic.  The response from those
   with a trace of originality is to remark ironically that the
   proposed name would then be `YABA-compatible'.  Also used in
   response to questions like "What is WYSIWYG?"  See also

<p><b>YAFIYGI</b> /yaf'ee-y*-gee/ adj. <p>

   WYSIWYG] Describes the command-oriented ed/vi/nroff/TeX style of
   word processing or other user interface, the opposite of
   <b><a href="#WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a></b>.  Stands for "You asked for it, you got it", because
   what you actually asked for is often not apparent until long after
   it is too late to do anything about it.  Used to denote perversity
   ("Real Programmers use YAFIYGI tools<small>...</small>and <em>like</em> it!") 
   or, less often, a necessary tradeoff ("Only a YAFIYGI tool can
   have full programmable flexibility in its interface.").

<p>This precise sense of "You asked for it, you got it" seems to
   have first appeared in Ed Post's classic parody "Real
   Programmers don't use Pascal" (see <b><a href="#Real%20Programmer">Real Programmer</a></b>s); the
   acronym is a more recent invention.

   when the action is performed with a debugger or binary patching
   tool.  Also implies surgical precision.  "Zap the debug level to 6

 "Every program attempts to expand until it

   and application platforms (the mailer thing, he says, is just a
   side effect of that).  It is commonly cited, though with widely
   varying degrees of accuracy.

 "Allow none of <b><a href="#foo">foo</a></b>,

   software design, which instructs one to not place <b><a href="#random">random</a></b>
   limits on the number of instances of a given entity (such as:
   windows in a window system, letters in an OS's filenames, etc.). 
   Specifically, one should either disallow the entity entirely, allow
   exactly one instance (an "exception"), or allow as many as the
   user wants - address space and memory permitting.

<p>The logic behind this rule is that there are often situations where
   it makes clear sense to allow one of something instead of none. 
   However, if one decides to go further and allow N (for N &gt; 1), then
   why not N+1?  And if N+1, then why not N+2, and so on?  Once above
   1, there's no excuse not to allow any N; hence, <b><a href="#infinity">infinity</a></b>.

<p>Many hackers recall in this connection Isaac Asimov's SF novel

 First.  Among software designers,

   people also tend to start counting at 0 instead of 1; this is
   natural since, e.g., the 256 states of 8 bits correspond to the
   binary numbers 0, 1, <small>...</small>, 255 and the digital devices known as
   `counters' count in this way.

<p>Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first
   chapter of a publication `Chapter 0', especially if it is of an
   introductory nature (one of the classic instances was in the First
   Edition of <b><a href="#K&amp;R">K&amp;R</a></b>).  In recent years this trait has also been
   observed among many pure mathematicians (who have an independent
   tradition of numbering from 0).  Zero-based numbering tends to
   reduce <b><a href="#fencepost%20error">fencepost error</a></b>s, though it cannot eliminate them
   entirely.

<h2>The Meaning of `Hack'</h2>

<p>"The word <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b> doesn't really have 69 different meanings",
according to MIT hacker Phil Agre.  "In fact, <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b> has only one
meaning, an extremely subtle and profound one which defies
articulation.  Which connotation is implied by a given use of the word
depends in similarly profound ways on the context.  Similar remarks
apply to a couple of other hacker words, most notably <b><a href="#random">random</a></b>."

<p>Hacking might be characterized as `an appropriate application of
ingenuity'.  Whether the result is a quick-and-dirty patchwork job or
a carefully crafted work of art, you have to admire the cleverness
that went into it.

<p>An important secondary meaning of <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b> is `a creative practical
joke'.  This kind of hack is easier to explain to non-hackers than the
programming kind.  Of course, some hacks have both natures; see the
lexicon entries for <b><a href="#pseudo">pseudo</a></b> and <b><a href="#kgbvax">kgbvax</a></b>.  But here are some
examples of pure practical jokes that illustrate the hacking spirit:

<blockquote>
In 1961, students from Caltech (California Institute of Technology, in
Pasadena) hacked the Rose Bowl football game.  One student posed as a
reporter and `interviewed' the director of the University of
Washington card stunts (such stunts involve people in the stands who
hold up colored cards to make pictures).  The reporter learned exactly
how the stunts were operated, and also that the director would be out
to dinner later.

<p>While the director was eating, the students (who called themselves the
`Fiendish Fourteen') picked a lock and stole a blank direction sheet
for the card stunts.  They then had a printer run off 2300 copies of
the blank.  The next day they picked the lock again and stole the
master plans for the stunts -- large sheets of graph paper colored in
with the stunt pictures.  Using these as a guide, they made new
instructions for three of the stunts on the duplicated blanks. 
Finally, they broke in once more, replacing the stolen master plans
and substituting the stack of diddled instruction sheets for the
original set.

<p>The result was that three of the pictures were totally different. 
Instead of `WASHINGTON', the word ``CALTECH' was flashed.  Another
stunt showed the word `HUSKIES', the Washington nickname, but
spelled it backwards.  And what was supposed to have been a picture of
a husky instead showed a beaver.  (Both Caltech and MIT use the beaver
-- nature's engineer -- as a mascot.)

<p>After the game, the Washington faculty athletic representative said:
"Some thought it ingenious; others were indignant."  The Washington
student body president remarked: "No hard feelings, but at the time
it was unbelievable.  We were amazed." 
</blockquote>

<p>This is now considered a classic hack, particularly because revising
the direction sheets constituted a form of programming.

<p>Here is another classic hack:

<blockquote>
On November 20, 1982, MIT hacked the Harvard-Yale football game.  Just
after Harvard's second touchdown against Yale, in the first quarter, a
small black ball popped up out of the ground at the 40-yard line, and
grew bigger, and bigger, and bigger.  The letters `MIT' appeared all
over the ball.  As the players and officials stood around gawking, the
ball grew to six feet in diameter and then burst with a bang and a
cloud of white smoke.

<p>The "Boston Globe" later reported: "If you want to know the truth,
MIT won The Game."

<p>The prank had taken weeks of careful planning by members of MIT's
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.  The device consisted of a weather
balloon, a hydraulic ram powered by Freon gas to lift it out of the
ground, and a vacuum-cleaner motor to inflate it.  They made eight
separate expeditions to Harvard Stadium between 1 and 5 <small>A.M.</small>,
locating an unused 110-volt circuit in the stadium and running buried
wires from the stadium circuit to the 40-yard line, where they buried
the balloon device.  When the time came to activate the device, two
fraternity members had merely to flip a circuit breaker and push a
plug into an outlet.

<p>This stunt had all the earmarks of a perfect hack: surprise,
publicity, the ingenious use of technology, safety, and harmlessness. 
The use of manual control allowed the prank to be timed so as not to
disrupt the game (it was set off between plays, so the outcome of the
game would not be unduly affected).  The perpetrators had even
thoughtfully attached a note to the balloon explaining that the device
was not dangerous and contained no explosives.

<p>Harvard president Derek Bok commented: "They have an awful lot of
clever people down there at MIT, and they did it again."  President
Paul E. Gray of MIT said: "There is absolutely no truth to the rumor
that I had anything to do with it, but I wish there were." 
</blockquote>

<p>The hacks above are verifiable history; they can be proved to have
happened.  Many other classic-hack stories from MIT and elsewhere,
though retold as history, have the characteristics of what Jan
Brunvand has called `urban folklore' (see <b><a href="#FOAF">FOAF</a></b>).  Perhaps the
best known of these is the legend of the infamous trolley-car hack, an
alleged incident in which engineering students are said to have welded
a trolley car to its tracks with thermite.  Numerous versions of this
have been recorded from the 1940s to the present, most set at MIT but
at least one very detailed version set at CMU.

<p>Brian Leibowitz has researched MIT hacks both real and mythical
extensively; the interested reader is referred to his delightful
pictorial compendium "The Journal of the Institute for Hacks,
Tomfoolery, and Pranks" (MIT Museum, 1990; ISBN 0-917027-03-5). 
The Institute has a World Wide Web page at
<a href="http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/Gallery.html">http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/Gallery.html</a>. There is rumored to
be a sequel entitled "Is This The Way To Baker Street?".  The
Caltech Alumni Association has published two similar books titled
"Legends of Caltech" and "More Legends of Caltech".

<p>Here is a story about one of the classic computer hacks:

<blockquote>
Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola
discovered a relatively simple way to crack system security on the
Xerox CP-V timesharing system.  Through a simple programming strategy,
it was possible for a user program to trick the system into running a
portion of the program in `master mode' (supervisor state), in which
memory protection does not apply.  The program could then poke a large
value into its `privilege level' byte (normally write-protected) and
could then proceed to bypass all levels of security within the
file-management system, patch the system monitor, and do numerous
other interesting things.  In short, the barn door was wide open.

<p>Motorola quite properly reported this problem to Xerox via an official
`level 1 SIDR' (a bug report with an intended urgency of `needs to be
fixed yesterday').  Because the text of each SIDR was entered into a
database that could be viewed by quite a number of people, Motorola
followed the approved procedure: they simply reported the problem as
`Security SIDR', and attached all of the necessary documentation,
ways-to-reproduce, etc.

<p>The CP-V people at Xerox sat on their thumbs; they either didn't
realize the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary
operating-system-staff resources to develop and distribute an official
patch.

<p>Months passed.  The Motorola guys pestered their Xerox field-support
rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take direct action, to
demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the system could be
cracked and just how thoroughly the security safeguards could be
subverted.

<p>They dug around in the operating-system listings and devised a
thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then
incorporated into a pair of programs called `Robin Hood' and `Friar
Tuck'.  Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as `ghost jobs'
(daemons, in Unix terminology); they would use the existing loophole
to subvert system security, install the necessary patches, and then
keep an eye on one another's statuses in order to keep the system
operator (in effect, the superuser) from aborting them.

<p>One fine day, the system operator on the main CP-V software
development system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual
phenomena.  These included the following:

<ul>
<li>Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of a
job. 
<li>Disk drives would seek back and forth so rapidly that they would attempt
to walk across the floor (see <b><a href="#walking%20drives">walking drives</a></b>). 
<li>The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself and
punch a <b><a href="#lace%20card">lace card</a></b>.  These would usually jam in the punch. 
<li>The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin Hood
to Friar Tuck, or vice versa. 
<li>The Xerox card reader had two output stackers; it could be instructed
to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A (unless a card was
unreadable, in which case the bad card was placed into stacker B).  One
of the patches installed by the ghosts added some code to the
card-reader driver<small>...</small> after reading a card, it would flip over to
the opposite stacker.  As a result, card decks would divide themselves
in half when they were read, leaving the operator to recollate them
manually. 
</ul>

<p>Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers. 
They found the bandit ghost jobs running, and <b><a href="#gun">gun</a></b>ned them<small>...</small>
and were once again surprised.  When Robin Hood was gunned, the
following sequence of events took place:

<pre>!X id1

id1: Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!
id1: Off (aborted)

id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff
     of Nottingham's men!

id1: Thank you, my good fellow!
</pre>

<p>Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed,
and would start a new copy of the recently slain program within a few
milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them
simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.

<p>Finally, the system programmers did the latter -- only to find
that the bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It
turned out that these two programs had patched the boot-time OS image
(the kernel file, in Unix terms) and had added themselves to the list
of programs that were to be started at boot time (this is similar to
the way MS-DOS viruses propagate).

<p>The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when the
system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and
reinstalled the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch
for this problem.

<p>It is alleged that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management
about the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question. 
It is not recorded that any serious disciplinary action was taken
against either of them. 
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, here is a wonderful hack story for the new millennium:

<p>1990's addition to the hallowed tradition of April Fool RFCs was
RFC 1149, "A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on
Avian Carriers".  This sketched a method for transmitting IP packets
via carrier pigeons.

<p>Eleven years later, on 28 April 2001, the Bergen Linux User's Group
successfully demonstrated CPIP (Carrier Pigeon IP) between two Linux
machines running on opposite sides of a small mountain in Bergen,
Norway.  Their network stack used printers to hex-dump packets onto
paper, pigeons to transport the paper, and OCR software to read the
dumps at the other end and feed them to the receiving machine's
network layer.

<p>Here is the actual log of the ping command they successfully executed. 
Note the exceptional packet times.

<p>A web page documenting the event, with pictures, is at
<a href="http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/">http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/</a>. In the finest Internet
tradition, all software involved was open-source; the custom parts are
available for download from the site.

<p>While all acknowledged the magnitude of this achievement, some
debate ensued over whether BLUG's implementation was properly
conformant to the RFC.  It seems they had not used the duct tape
specified in 1149 to attach messages to pigeon legs, but instead
emnployed other methods less objectionable to the pigeons.  The
debate was properly resolved when it was pointed out that the
duct-tape specification was not prefixed by a MUST, and was thus
a recommendation rather than a requirement.

<p>The perpetrators finished their preliminary writeup in this wise:
"Now, we're waiting for someone to write other implementations, so
that we can do interoperability tests, and maybe we finally can get
the RFC into the standards track... ".

<p>The logical next step should be an implementation of RFC2549.

<h2>TV Typewriters: A Tale of Hackish Ingenuity</h2>

<p>Here is a true story about a glass tty:  One day an MIT hacker was in
a motorcycle accident and broke his leg.  He had to stay in the
hospital quite a while, and got restless because he couldn't <b><a href="#hack">hack</a></b>. 
Two of his friends therefore took a terminal and a modem for it to the
hospital, so that he could use the computer by telephone from his
hospital bed.

<p>Now this happened some years before the spread of home computers, and
computer terminals were not a familiar sight to the average person. 
When the two friends got to the hospital, a guard stopped them and
asked what they were carrying.  They explained that they wanted to
take a computer terminal to their friend who was a patient.

<p>The guard got out his list of things that patients were permitted to
have in their rooms: TV, radio, electric razor, typewriter, tape
player, <small>...</small> no computer terminals.  Computer terminals weren't on
the list, so the guard wouldn't let it in.  Rules are rules, you know. 
(This guard was clearly a <b><a href="#droid">droid</a></b>.)

<p>Fair enough, said the two friends, and they left again.  They were
frustrated, of course, because they knew that the terminal was as
harmless as a TV or anything else on the list<small>...</small> which gave them an
idea.

<p>The next day they returned, and the same thing happened: a guard
stopped them and asked what they were carrying.  They said: "This is
a TV typewriter!"  The guard was skeptical, so they plugged it in and
demonstrated it.  "See?  You just type on the keyboard and what you
type shows up on the TV screen."  Now the guard didn't stop to think
about how utterly useless a typewriter would be that didn't produce
any paper copies of what you typed; but this was clearly a TV
typewriter, no doubt about it.  So he checked his list: "A TV is all
right, a typewriter is all right <small>...</small> okay, take it on in!"

<p>[Historical note: Many years ago, "Popular Electronics" published
solder-it-yourself plans for a TV typewriter.  Despite the essential
uselessness of the device, it was an enormously popular project. 
Steve Ciarcia, the man behind "Byte" magazine's "Circuit Cellar"
feature, resurrected this ghost in one of his books of the early
1980s.  He ascribed its popularity (no doubt correctly) to the
feeling of power the builder could achieve by being able to decide
himself what would be shown on the TV. --ESR]

<p>[Antihistorical note: On September 23rd, 1992, the L.A. Times ran
the following bit in Steve Harvey's `Only in L.A.' column:

<blockquote>
   It must have been borrowed from a museum: Solomon Waters of
Altadena, a 6-year-old first-grader, came home from his first day of
school and excitedly told his mother how he had written on "a machine
that looks like a computer-but without the TV screen."

<p>She asked him if it could have been a "typewriter."

<p>"Yeah! Yeah!" he said. "That's what it was called." 
</blockquote>

<p>I have since investigated this matter and determined that many of
today's teenagers have never seen a slide rule, either<small>...</small>. - ESR]

<h2>A Story About `Magic'</h2>

<p>Some years ago, I (GLS) was snooping around in the cabinets that housed the MIT
AI Lab's PDP-10, and noticed a little switch glued to the frame of one cabinet. 
It was obviously a homebrew job, added by one of the lab's hardware hackers (no
one knows who).

<p>You don't touch an unknown switch on a computer without knowing what
it does, because you might crash the computer.  The switch was labeled
in a most unhelpful way.  It had two positions, and scrawled in pencil
on the metal switch body were the words `magic' and `more magic'. 
The switch was in the `more magic' position.

<p>I called another hacker over to look at it.  He had never seen the
switch before either.  Closer examination revealed that the switch
had only one wire running to it!  The other end of the wire did
disappear into the maze of wires inside the computer, but it's a basic
fact of electricity that a switch can't do anything unless there are
two wires connected to it.  This switch had a wire connected on one
side and no wire on its other side.

<p>It was clear that this switch was someone's idea of a silly joke. 
Convinced by our reasoning that the switch was inoperative, we flipped
it.  The computer instantly crashed.

<p>Imagine our utter astonishment.  We wrote it off as coincidence, but
nevertheless restored the switch to the `more magic' position before
reviving the computer.

<p>A year later, I told this story to yet another hacker, David Moon as I
recall.  He clearly doubted my sanity, or suspected me of a
supernatural belief in the power of this switch, or perhaps thought I
was fooling him with a bogus saga.  To prove it to him, I showed him
the very switch, still glued to the cabinet frame with only one wire
connected to it, still in the `more magic' position.  We scrutinized
the switch and its lone connection, and found that the other end of
the wire, though connected to the computer wiring, was connected to a
ground pin.  That clearly made the switch doubly useless: not only was
it electrically nonoperative, but it was connected to a place that
couldn't affect anything anyway.  So we flipped the switch.

<p>The computer promptly crashed.

<p>This time we ran for Richard Greenblatt, a long-time MIT hacker, who
was close at hand.  He had never noticed the switch before, either. 
He inspected it, concluded it was useless, got some diagonal cutters
and <b><a href="#dike">dike</a></b>d it out.  We then revived the computer and it has run fine
ever since.

<p>We still don't know how the switch crashed the machine.  There is a
theory that some circuit near the ground pin was marginal, and
flipping the switch changed the electrical capacitance enough to upset
the circuit as millionth-of-a-second pulses went through it.  But
we'll never know for sure; all we can really say is that the switch
was <b><a href="#magic">magic</a></b>.

<p>I still have that switch in my basement.  Maybe I'm silly, but I
usually keep it set on `more magic'.

<p>1994: Another explanation of this story has since been offered.  Note that
the switch body was metal.  Suppose that the non-connected side of the
switch was connected to the switch body (usually the body is connected
to a separate earth lug, but there are exceptions).  The body is
connected to the computer case, which is, presumably, grounded.  Now
the circuit ground within the machine isn't necessarily at the same
potential as the case ground, so flipping the switch connected the
circuit ground to the case ground, causing a voltage drop/jump which
reset the machine.  This was probably discovered by someone who found
out the hard way that there was a potential difference between the
two, and who then wired in the switch as a joke.

<h2>Some AI Koans</h2>

<p>These are some of the funniest examples of a genre of jokes told at
the MIT AI Lab about various noted hackers.  The original koans were
composed by Danny Hillis, who would later found Connection Machines,
Inc.  In reading these, it is at least useful to know that Minsky,
Sussman, and Drescher are AI researchers of note, that Tom Knight was
one of the Lisp machine's principal designers, and that David Moon
wrote much of Lisp Machine Lisp.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power
off and on.

<p>Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: "You cannot
fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding of what
is going wrong."

<p>Knight turned the machine off and on.

<p>The machine worked.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>One day a student came to Moon and said: "I understand how to
make a better garbage collector.  We must keep a reference count
of the pointers to each cons."

<p>Moon patiently told the student the following story:

<blockquote>
"One day a student came to Moon and said: `I understand how to make a
better garbage collector<small>...</small>
</blockquote>

<p>[Ed. note: Pure reference-count garbage collectors have problems with
circular structures that point to themselves.]

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as
he sat hacking at the PDP-6.

<p>"What are you doing?", asked Minsky.

<p>"I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe"
Sussman replied.

<p>"Why is the net wired randomly?", asked Minsky.

<p>"I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play",
Sussman said.

<p>Minsky then shut his eyes.

<p>"Why do you close your eyes?", Sussman asked his teacher.

<p>"So that the room will be empty."

<p>At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>A disciple of another sect once came to Drescher as he was
eating his morning meal.

<p>"I would like to give you this personality test", said the
outsider, "because I want you to be happy."

<p>Drescher took the paper that was offered him and put it into the
toaster, saying: "I wish the toaster to be happy, too."

<h2>OS and JEDGAR</h2>

<p>This story says a lot about the ITS ethos.

<p>On the ITS system there was a program that allowed you to see what was
being printed on someone else's terminal.  It spied on the other guy's
output by examining the insides of the monitor system.  The output spy
program was called OS.  Throughout the rest of the computer science world
(and at IBM too) OS means `operating system', but among old-time ITS
hackers it almost always meant `output spy'.

<p>OS could work because ITS purposely had very little in the way of
`protection' that prevented one user from trespassing on another's
areas.  Fair is fair, however.  There was another program that would
automatically notify you if anyone started to spy on your output.  It
worked in exactly the same way, by looking at the insides of the
operating system to see if anyone else was looking at the insides that
had to do with your output.  This `counterspy' program was called
JEDGAR (a six-letterism pronounced as two syllables: /jed'gr/), in
honor of the former head of the FBI.

<p>But there's more.  JEDGAR would ask the user for `license to kill'. 
If the user said yes, then JEDGAR would actually <b><a href="#gun">gun</a></b> the job of
the <b><a href="#luser">luser</a></b> who was spying.  Unfortunately, people found that this made
life too violent, especially when tourists learned about it.  One of
the systems hackers solved the problem by replacing JEDGAR with
another program that only pretended to do its job.  It took a long
time to do this, because every copy of JEDGAR had to be patched. 
To this day no one knows how many people never figured out that JEDGAR
had been defanged.

<p>Interestingly, there is still a security module named JEDGAR alive as
of late 1994 -- in the Unisys MCP for large systems.  It is unknown
to us whether the name is tribute or independent invention.

<h2>The Story of Mel</h2>

<p>This was posted to Usenet by its author, Ed Nather
(<a href="mailto:&lt;nather@astro.as.utexas.edu&gt;">&lt;nather@astro.as.utexas.edu&gt;</a>), on May 21, 1983.

<pre>
A recent article devoted to the <em>macho</em> side of programming
made the bald and unvarnished statement:

    Real Programmers write in FORTRAN.

Maybe they do now,
in this decadent era of
Lite beer, hand calculators, and ``user-friendly'' software
but back in the Good Old Days,
when the term ``software'' sounded funny
and Real Computers were made out of drums and vacuum tubes,
Real Programmers wrote in machine code.
Not FORTRAN.  Not RATFOR.  Not, even, assembly language.
Machine Code.
Raw, unadorned, inscrutable hexadecimal numbers.
Directly.

Lest a whole new generation of programmers
grow up in ignorance of this glorious past,
I feel duty-bound to describe,
as best I can through the generation gap,
how a Real Programmer wrote code.
I'll call him Mel,
because that was his name.

I first met Mel when I went to work for Royal McBee Computer Corp.,
a now-defunct subsidiary of the typewriter company.
The firm manufactured the LGP-30,
a small, cheap (by the standards of the day)
drum-memory computer,
and had just started to manufacture
the RPC-4000, a much-improved,
bigger, better, faster --- drum-memory computer.
Cores cost too much,
and weren't here to stay, anyway.
(That's why you haven't heard of the company,
or the computer.)

I had been hired to write a FORTRAN compiler
for this new marvel and Mel was my guide to its wonders.
Mel didn't approve of compilers.

``If a program can't rewrite its own code'',
he asked, ``what good is it?''

Mel had written,
in hexadecimal,
the most popular computer program the company owned.
It ran on the LGP-30
and played blackjack with potential customers
at computer shows.
Its effect was always dramatic.
The LGP-30 booth was packed at every show,
and the IBM salesmen stood around
talking to each other.
Whether or not this actually sold computers
was a question we never discussed.

Mel's job was to re-write
the blackjack program for the RPC-4000.
(Port?  What does that mean?)
The new computer had a one-plus-one
addressing scheme,
in which each machine instruction,
in addition to the operation code
and the address of the needed operand,
had a second address that indicated where, on the revolving drum,
the next instruction was located.

In modern parlance,
every single instruction was followed by a GO TO!
Put <em>that</em> in Pascal's pipe and smoke it.

Mel loved the RPC-4000
because he could optimize his code:
that is, locate instructions on the drum
so that just as one finished its job,
the next would be just arriving at the ``read head''
and available for immediate execution.
There was a program to do that job,
an ``optimizing assembler'',
but Mel refused to use it.

``You never know where it's going to put things'',
he explained, ``so you'd have to use separate constants''.

It was a long time before I understood that remark.
Since Mel knew the numerical value
of every operation code,
and assigned his own drum addresses,
every instruction he wrote could also be considered
a numerical constant.
He could pick up an earlier ``add'' instruction, say,
and multiply by it,
if it had the right numeric value.
His code was not easy for someone else to modify.

I compared Mel's hand-optimized programs
with the same code massaged by the optimizing assembler program,
and Mel's always ran faster.
That was because the ``top-down'' method of program design
hadn't been invented yet,
and Mel wouldn't have used it anyway.
He wrote the innermost parts of his program loops first,
so they would get first choice
of the optimum address locations on the drum.
The optimizing assembler wasn't smart enough to do it that way.

Mel never wrote time-delay loops, either,
even when the balky Flexowriter
required a delay between output characters to work right.
He just located instructions on the drum
so each successive one was just <em>past</em> the read head
when it was needed;
the drum had to execute another complete revolution
to find the next instruction.
He coined an unforgettable term for this procedure.
Although ``optimum'' is an absolute term,
like ``unique'', it became common verbal practice
to make it relative:
``not quite optimum'' or ``less optimum''
or ``not very optimum''.
Mel called the maximum time-delay locations
the ``most pessimum''.

After he finished the blackjack program
and got it to run
(``Even the initializer is optimized'',
he said proudly),
he got a Change Request from the sales department.
The program used an elegant (optimized)
random number generator
to shuffle the ``cards'' and deal from the ``deck'',
and some of the salesmen felt it was too fair,
since sometimes the customers lost.
They wanted Mel to modify the program
so, at the setting of a sense switch on the console,
they could change the odds and let the customer win.

Mel balked.
He felt this was patently dishonest,
which it was,
and that it impinged on his personal integrity as a programmer,
which it did,
so he refused to do it.
The Head Salesman talked to Mel,
as did the Big Boss and, at the boss's urging,
a few Fellow Programmers.
Mel finally gave in and wrote the code,
but he got the test backwards,
and, when the sense switch was turned on,
the program would cheat, winning every time.
Mel was delighted with this,
claiming his subconscious was uncontrollably ethical,
and adamantly refused to fix it.

After Mel had left the company for greener pa$ture$,
the Big Boss asked me to look at the code
and see if I could find the test and reverse it.
Somewhat reluctantly, I agreed to look.
Tracking Mel's code was a real adventure.

I have often felt that programming is an art form,
whose real value can only be appreciated
by another versed in the same arcane art;
there are lovely gems and brilliant coups
hidden from human view and admiration, sometimes forever,
by the very nature of the process.
You can learn a lot about an individual
just by reading through his code,
even in hexadecimal.
Mel was, I think, an unsung genius.

Perhaps my greatest shock came
when I found an innocent loop that had no test in it.
No test.  <em>None</em>.
Common sense said it had to be a closed loop,
where the program would circle, forever, endlessly.
Program control passed right through it, however,
and safely out the other side.
It took me two weeks to figure it out.

The RPC-4000 computer had a really modern facility
called an index register.
It allowed the programmer to write a program loop
that used an indexed instruction inside;
each time through,
the number in the index register
was added to the address of that instruction,
so it would refer
to the next datum in a series.
He had only to increment the index register
each time through.
Mel never used it.

Instead, he would pull the instruction into a machine register,
add one to its address,
and store it back.
He would then execute the modified instruction
right from the register.
The loop was written so this additional execution time
was taken into account ---
just as this instruction finished,
the next one was right under the drum's read head,
ready to go.
But the loop had no test in it.

The vital clue came when I noticed
the index register bit,
the bit that lay between the address
and the operation code in the instruction word,
was turned on ---
yet Mel never used the index register,
leaving it zero all the time.
When the light went on it nearly blinded me.

He had located the data he was working on
near the top of memory ---
the largest locations the instructions could address ---
so, after the last datum was handled,
incrementing the instruction address
would make it overflow.
The carry would add one to the
operation code, changing it to the next one in the instruction set:
a jump instruction.
Sure enough, the next program instruction was
in address location zero,
and the program went happily on its way.

I haven't kept in touch with Mel,
so I don't know if he ever gave in to the flood of
change that has washed over programming techniques
since those long-gone days.
I like to think he didn't.
In any event,
I was impressed enough that I quit looking for the
offending test,
telling the Big Boss I couldn't find it.
He didn't seem surprised.

When I left the company,
the blackjack program would still cheat
if you turned on the right sense switch,
and I think that's how it should be.
I didn't feel comfortable
hacking up the code of a Real Programmer.

<br><p>
<br><p>
<p>This is one of hackerdom's great heroic epics, free verse or no.  In a
few spare images it captures more about the esthetics and psychology
of hacking than all the scholarly volumes on the subject put together. 
For an opposing point of view, see the entry for <b><a href="#Real%20Programmer">Real Programmer</a></b>.

<p>[1992 postscript -- the author writes: "The original submission to
the net was not in free verse, nor any approximation to it -- it was
straight prose style, in non-justified paragraphs.  In bouncing around
the net it apparently got modified into the `free verse' form now
popular.  In other words, it got hacked on the net.  That seems
appropriate, somehow." The author adds that he likes the `free-verse'
version better than his prose original...]

<p>[1999 update: Mel's last name is now known.  The manual for the LGP-30
refers to "Mel Kaye of Royal McBee who did the bulk of the
programming [...] of the ACT 1 system".]

<p>[2001: The Royal McBee LPG-30 turns out to have one other claim to
fame. It turns out that meteorologist Edward Lorenz was doing weather
simulations on an LGP-30 when, in 1961, he discovered the "Butterfly
Theorem" and computational chaos.  This seems, somehow, appropriate.]

<h1>A Portrait of J. Random Hacker</h1>

<p>This profile reflects detailed comments on an earlier `trial balloon'
version from about a hundred Usenet respondents.  Where comparatives
are used, the implicit `other' is a randomly selected segment of the
non-hacker population of the same size as hackerdom.

<p>An important point: Except in some relatively minor respects such as
slang vocabulary, hackers don't get to be the way they are by
imitating each other.  Rather, it seems to be the case that the
combination of personality traits that makes a hacker so conditions
one's outlook on life that one tends to end up being like other
hackers whether one wants to or not (much as bizarrely detailed
similarities in behavior and preferences are found in genetic twins
raised separately).

<h2>General Appearance</h2>

<p>Intelligent.  Scruffy.  Intense.  Abstracted.  Surprisingly for a
sedentary profession, more hackers run to skinny than fat; both
extremes are more common than elsewhere.  Tans are rare.

<br>

<h2>Dress</h2>

<p>Casual, vaguely post-hippie; T-shirts, jeans, running shoes,
Birkenstocks (or bare feet).  Long hair, beards, and moustaches are
common.  High incidence of tie-dye and intellectual or humorous
`slogan' T-shirts.  Until the mid-1990s such T-shirts were seldom
computer-related, as that would have been too obvious - but the
hacker culture has since developed its own icons, and J. Random
Hacker now often wears a Linux penguin or BSD daemon or a DeCSS
protest shirt.

<p>A substantial minority prefers `outdoorsy' clothing -- hiking boots
("in case a mountain should suddenly spring up in the machine room",
as one famous parody put it), khakis, lumberjack or chamois shirts, and
the like.

<p>After about 1995 hacker dress styles assimilated some influence from
punk, gothic, and rave subcultures.  This was relatively mild and has
manifested mostly as a tendency to wear a lot of black, especially
when `dressed up' to the limit of formality.  Other markers of those
subcultures such as piercings, chains, and dyed hair remain relatively
uncommon.

<p>Very few hackers actually fit the "National Lampoon" Nerd
stereotype, though it lingers on at MIT and may have been more common
before 1975.  At least since the late Seventies backpacks have been
more common than briefcases, and the hacker `look' has been more
whole-earth than whole-polyester.

<p>Hackers dress for comfort, function, and minimal maintenance hassles
rather than for appearance (some, perhaps unfortunately, take this to
extremes and neglect personal hygiene).  They have a very low
tolerance of suits and other `business' attire; in fact, it is not
uncommon for hackers to quit a job rather than conform to a dress
code.  When they are somehow backed into conforming to a dress code,
they will find ways to subvert it, for example by wearing absurd
novelty ties.

<p>Female hackers almost never wear visible makeup, and many use none at
all.

<h2>Reading Habits</h2>

<p>Omnivorous, but usually includes lots of science and science fiction. 
The typical hacker household might subscribe to "Analog",
"Scientific American", "Whole-Earth Review", and
"Smithsonian" (most hackers ignore "Wired" and other
self-consciously `cyberpunk' magazines, considering them
<b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b> fodder).  Hackers often have a reading range that
astonishes liberal arts people but tend not to talk about it as much. 
Many hackers spend as much of their spare time reading as the average
American burns up watching TV, and often keep shelves and shelves of
well-thumbed books in their homes.

<h2>Other Interests</h2>

<p>Some hobbies are widely shared and recognized as going with the
culture: science fiction, music, medievalism (in the active form
practiced by the Society for Creative Anachronism and similar
organizations), chess, go, backgammon, wargames, and intellectual
games of all kinds.  (Role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons
used to be extremely popular among hackers but they lost a bit of
their luster as they moved into the mainstream and became heavily
commercialized.  More recently, "Magic: The Gathering" has been
widely popular among hackers.)  Logic puzzles.  Ham radio.  Other
interests that seem to correlate less strongly but positively with
hackerdom include linguistics and theater teching.

<br>

<h2>Physical Activity and Sports</h2>

<p>Many (perhaps even most) hackers don't follow or do sports at all and
are determinedly anti-physical.  Among those who do, interest in
spectator sports is low to non-existent; sports are something one
<em>does</em>, not something one watches on TV.

<p>Further, hackers avoid most team sports like the plague.  Volleyball
was long a notable exception, perhaps because it's non-contact and
relatively friendly; Ultimate Frisbee has become quite popular for
similar reasons.  Hacker sports are almost always primarily
self-competitive ones involving concentration, stamina, and micromotor
skills: martial arts, bicycling, auto racing, kite flying, hiking,
rock climbing, aviation, target-shooting, sailing, caving, juggling,
skiing, skating, skydiving, scuba diving.  Hackers' delight in
techno-toys also tends to draw them towards hobbies with nifty
complicated equipment that they can tinker with.

<p>The popularity of martial arts in the hacker culture deserves special
mention.  Many observers have noted it, and the connection has grown
noticeably stronger over time.  In the 1970s, many hackers admired
martial arts disciplines from a distance, sensing a compatible ideal
in their exaltation of skill through rigorous self-discipline and
concentration.  As martial arts became increasingly mainstreamed in
the U.S. and other western countries, hackers moved from admiring to
doing in large numbers.  In 1997, for example, your humble editor
recalls sitting down with five strangers at the first Perl conference
and discovering that four of us were in active training in some sort
of martial art - and, what is more interesting, nobody at the table
found this particularly odd.

<p>Today (2000), martial arts seems to have become firmly established as the
hacker exercise form of choice, and the martial-arts culture combining
skill-centered elitism with a willingness to let anybody join seems a
stronger parallel to hacker behavior than ever.  Common usages in
hacker slang un-ironically analogize programming to kung fu (thus, one
hears talk of "code-fu" or in reference to specific skills like
"HTML-fu").  Albeit with slightly more irony, today's hackers
readily analogize assimilation into the hacker culture with the plot
of a Jet Li movie: the aspiring newbie studies with masters of the
tradition, develops his art through deep meditation, ventures forth to
perform heroic feats of hacking, and eventually becomes a master who
trains the next generation of newbies.

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>Nearly all hackers past their teens are either college-degreed or
self-educated to an equivalent level.  The self-taught hacker is often
considered (at least by other hackers) to be better-motivated, and may
be more respected, than his school-shaped counterpart.  Academic areas
from which people often gravitate into hackerdom include (besides the
obvious computer science and electrical engineering) physics,
mathematics, linguistics, and philosophy.

movies, and good SF like "Star Trek" classic or Babylon 5). 
Business suits.  Dishonesty.  Incompetence.  Boredom.  COBOL. BASIC.

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>Ethnic.  Spicy.  Oriental, esp. Chinese and most esp. Szechuan,
Hunan, and Mandarin (hackers consider Cantonese vaguely <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;</i>). 
Hackers prefer the exotic; for example, the Japanese-food fans among
them will eat with gusto such delicacies as fugu (poisonous
pufferfish) and whale.  Thai food has experienced flurries of
popularity.  Where available, high-quality Jewish delicatessen food is
much esteemed.  A visible minority of Southwestern and Pacific Coast
hackers prefers Mexican.

<p>For those all-night hacks, pizza and microwaved burritos are big. 
Interestingly, though the mainstream culture has tended to think of
hackers as incorrigible junk-food junkies, many have at least mildly
health-foodist attitudes and are fairly discriminating about what they
eat.  This may be generational; anecdotal evidence suggests that the
stereotype was more on the mark before the early 1980s.

<h2>Politics</h2>

<p>Vaguely liberal-moderate, except for the strong libertarian contingent
which rejects conventional left-right politics entirely.  The only
safe generalization is that hackers tend to be rather
anti-authoritarian; thus, both conventional conservatism and `hard'
leftism are rare.  Hackers are far more likely than most non-hackers
to either (a) be aggressively apolitical or (b) entertain peculiar or
idiosyncratic political ideas and actually try to live by them
day-to-day.

<h2>Gender and Ethnicity</h2>

<p>Hackerdom is still predominantly male.  However, the percentage of
women is clearly higher than the low-single-digit range typical for
technical professions, and female hackers are generally respected and
dealt with as equals.

<p>In the U.S., hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong
minorities of Jews (East Coast) and Orientals (West Coast).  The
Jewish contingent has exerted a particularly pervasive cultural
influence (see <b><a href="#Food">Food</a></b>, above, and note that several common jargon
terms are obviously mutated Yiddish).

<p>The ethnic distribution of hackers is understood by them to be a
function of which ethnic groups tend to seek and value education.  Racial
and ethnic prejudice is notably uncommon and tends to be met with
freezing contempt.

<p>When asked, hackers often ascribe their culture's gender- and
color-blindness to a positive effect of text-only network channels,
and this is doubtless a powerful influence.  Also, the ties many
hackers have to AI research and SF literature may have helped them to
develop an idea of personhood that is inclusive rather than exclusive
-- after all, if one's imagination readily grants full human rights
to future AI programs, robots, dolphins, and extraterrestrial aliens,
mere color and gender can't seem very important any more.

<br>

<h2>Religion</h2>

<p>Agnostic.  Atheist.  Non-observant Jewish.  Neo-pagan.  Very commonly,
three or more of these are combined in the same person.  Conventional
faith-holding Christianity is rare though not unknown.

<p>Even hackers who identify with a religious affiliation tend to be
relaxed about it, hostile to organized religion in general and all
forms of religious bigotry in particular.  Many enjoy `parody'
religions such as Discordianism and the Church of the SubGenius.

<p>Also, many hackers are influenced to varying degrees by Zen Buddhism
or (less commonly) Taoism, and blend them easily with their `native'
religions.

<p>There is a definite strain of mystical, almost Gnostic sensibility
that shows up even among those hackers not actively involved with
neo-paganism, Discordianism, or Zen.  Hacker folklore that pays homage
to `wizards' and speaks of incantations and demons has too much
psychological truthfulness about it to be entirely a joke.

<h2>Ceremonial Chemicals</h2>

<p>Most hackers don't smoke tobacco, and use alcohol in moderation if at
all.  However, there has been something of a trend towards exotic
beers since about 1995, especially among younger Linux hackers
apparently influenced by Linus Torvalds's fondness for Guinness.

<p>Limited use of non-addictive psychedelic drugs, such as cannabis, LSD,
psilocybin, nitrous oxide, etc., used to be relatively common and is
still regarded with more tolerance than in the mainstream culture. 
Use of `downers' and opiates, on the other hand, appears to be
particularly rare; hackers seem in general to dislike drugs that make
them stupid. But <b><a href="#on%20the%20gripping%20hand">on the gripping hand</a></b>, many hackers regularly
wire up on caffeine and/or sugar for all-night hacking runs.

<br>

<h2>Communication Style</h2>

<p>See the discussions of speech and writing styles near the beginning of
this File.  Though hackers often have poor person-to-person
communication skills, they are as a rule quite sensitive to nuances of
language and very precise in their use of it.  They are often better
at writing than at speaking.

<h2>Geographical Distribution</h2>

<p>In the United States, hackerdom revolves on a Bay Area-to-Boston axis;
about half of the hard core seems to live within a hundred miles of
Cambridge (Massachusetts) or Berkeley (California), although there are
significant contingents in Los Angeles, in the Pacific Northwest, and
around Washington DC.  Hackers tend to cluster around large cities,
especially `university towns' such as the Raleigh-Durham area in
North Carolina or Princeton, New Jersey (this may simply reflect the
fact that many are students or ex-students living near their alma
maters).

<br>

<h2>Sexual Habits</h2>

<p>Hackerdom easily tolerates a much wider range of sexual and lifestyle
variation than the mainstream culture.  It includes a relatively large
gay and bisexual contingent.  Hackers are somewhat more likely to live
in polygynous or polyandrous relationships, practice open marriage, or
live in communes or group houses.  In this, as in general appearance,
hackerdom semi-consciously maintains `counterculture' values.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Appendix%20B">Appendix B</a>
<br>

<h2>Personality Characteristics</h2>

<p>The most obvious common `personality' characteristics of hackers are
high intelligence, consuming curiosity, and facility with intellectual
abstractions.  Also, most hackers are `neophiles', stimulated by and
appreciative of novelty (especially intellectual novelty).  Most are
also relatively individualistic and anti-conformist.

<p>Although high general intelligence is common among hackers, it is not
the <i>sine qua non</i> one might expect.  Another trait is probably even
more important: the ability to mentally absorb, retain, and reference
large amounts of `meaningless' detail, trusting to later experience
to give it context and meaning.  A person of merely average analytical
intelligence who has this trait can become an effective hacker, but a
creative genius who lacks it will swiftly find himself outdistanced by
people who routinely upload the contents of thick reference manuals
into their brains.  [During the production of the first book version
of this document, for example, I learned most of the rather complex
typesetting language TeX over about four working days, mainly by
inhaling Knuth's 477-page manual.  My editor's flabbergasted reaction
to this genuinely surprised me, because years of associating with
hackers have conditioned me to consider such performances routine and
to be expected. --ESR]

<p>Contrary to stereotype, hackers are <em>not</em> usually intellectually
narrow; they tend to be interested in any subject that can provide
mental stimulation, and can often discourse knowledgeably and even
interestingly on any number of obscure subjects -- if you can get
them to talk at all, as opposed to, say, going back to their hacking.

<p>It is noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that
the better a hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to have
outside interests at which he or she is more than merely competent.

<p>Hackers are `control freaks' in a way that has nothing to do with the
usual coercive or authoritarian connotations of the term.  In the same
way that children delight in making model trains go forward and back
by moving a switch, hackers love making complicated things like
computers do nifty stuff for them.  But it has to be <em>their</em>
nifty stuff.  They don't like tedium, nondeterminism, or most of the
fussy, boring, ill-defined little tasks that go with maintaining a
normal existence.  Accordingly, they tend to be careful and orderly in
their intellectual lives and chaotic elsewhere.  Their code will be
beautiful, even if their desks are buried in 3 feet of crap.

<p>Hackers are generally only very weakly motivated by conventional
rewards such as social approval or money.  They tend to be attracted
by challenges and excited by interesting toys, and to judge the
interest of work or other activities in terms of the challenges
offered and the toys they get to play with.

<p>In terms of Myers-Briggs and equivalent psychometric systems,
hackerdom appears to concentrate the relatively rare INTJ and INTP
types; that is, introverted, intuitive, and thinker types (as opposed
to the extroverted-sensate personalities that predominate in the
mainstream culture).  ENT[JP] types are also concentrated among
hackers but are in a minority.

<br>

<h2>Weaknesses of the Hacker Personality</h2>

<p>Hackers have relatively little ability to identify emotionally with
other people.  This may be because hackers generally aren't much like
`other people'.  Unsurprisingly, hackers also tend towards
self-absorption, intellectual arrogance, and impatience with people
and tasks perceived to be wasting their time.

<p>As cynical as hackers sometimes wax about the amount of idiocy in the
world, they tend by reflex to assume that everyone is as rational,
`cool', and imaginative as they consider themselves.  This bias often
contributes to weakness in communication skills.  Hackers tend to be
especially poor at confrontation and negotiation.

<p>Because of their passionate embrace of (what they consider to be) the
<b><a href="#Right%20Thing">Right Thing</a></b>, hackers can be unfortunately intolerant and bigoted
on technical issues, in marked contrast to their general spirit of
camaraderie and tolerance of alternative viewpoints otherwise. 
Old-time <b><a href="#ITS">ITS</a></b> partisans look down on the ever-growing hordes of
<b><a href="#Unix">Unix</a></b> hackers; Unix aficionados despise <b><a href="#VMS">VMS</a></b> and <b><a href="#MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a></b>;
and hackers who are used to conventional command-line user interfaces
loudly loathe mouse-and-menu based systems such as the Macintosh. 
Hackers who don't indulge in <b><a href="#Usenet">Usenet</a></b> consider it a huge waste of
time and <b><a href="#bandwidth">bandwidth</a></b>; fans of old adventure games such as
<b><a href="#ADVENT">ADVENT</a></b> and <b><a href="#Zork">Zork</a></b> consider <b><a href="#MUD">MUD</a></b>s to be glorified chat
systems devoid of atmosphere or interesting puzzles; hackers who are
willing to devote endless hours to Usenet or MUDs consider <b><a href="#IRC">IRC</a></b> to
be a <em>real</em> waste of time; IRCies think MUDs might be okay if
there weren't all those silly puzzles in the way.  And, of course,
there are the perennial <b><a href="#holy%20wars">holy wars</a></b> -- <b><a href="#EMACS">EMACS</a></b> vs. <b><a href="#vi">vi</a></b>,
<b><a href="#big-endian">big-endian</a></b> vs.  <b><a href="#little-endian">little-endian</a></b>, RISC vs. CISC, etc., etc.,
etc.  As in society at large, the intensity and duration of these
debates is usually inversely proportional to the number of objective,
factual arguments available to buttress any position.

<p>As a result of all the above traits, many hackers have difficulty
maintaining stable relationships.  At worst, they can produce the
classic <b><a href="#geek">geek</a></b>: withdrawn, relationally incompetent, sexually
frustrated, and desperately unhappy when not submerged in his or her
craft.  Fortunately, this extreme is far less common than mainstream
folklore paints it -- but almost all hackers will recognize something
of themselves in the unflattering paragraphs above.

<p>Hackers are often monumentally disorganized and sloppy about dealing
with the physical world.  Bills don't get paid on time, clutter piles
up to incredible heights in homes and offices, and minor maintenance
tasks get deferred indefinitely.

<p>1994-95's fad behavioral disease was a syndrome called Attention
Deficit Disorder (ADD), supposedly characterized by (among other
things) a combination of short attention span with an ability to
`hyperfocus' imaginatively on interesting tasks.  In 1998-1999 another
syndrome that is said to overlap with many hacker traits entered
popular awareness: Asperger's syndrome (AS).  This disorder is also
sometimes called `high-function autism', though researchers are
divided on whether AS is in fact a mild form of autism or a distinct
syndrome with a different etiology.  AS patients exhibit mild to
severe deficits in interpreting facial and body-language cues and in
modeling or empathizing with others' emotions.  Though some AS
patients exhibit mild retardation, others compensate for their
deficits with high intelligence and analytical ability, and frequently
seek out technical fields where problem-solving abilities are at a
premium and people skills are relatively unimportant.  Both syndromes
are thought to relate to abnormalities in neurotransmitter chemistry,
especially the brain's processing of serotonin.

<p>Many hackers have noticed that mainstream culture has shown a tendency
to pathologize and medicalize normal variations in personality,
especially those variations that make life more complicated for
authority figures and conformists. Thus, hackers aware of the issue
tend to be among those questioning whether ADD and AS actually exist;
and if so whether they are really `diseases' rather than extremes of a
normal genetic variation like having freckles or being able to taste
DPT.  In either case, they have a sneaking tendency to wonder if these
syndromes are over-diagnosed and over-treated.  After all, people in
authority will always be inconvenienced by schoolchildren or workers
or citizens who are prickly, intelligent individualists - thus, any
social system that depends on authority relationships will tend to
helpfully ostracize and therapize and drug such `abnormal' people
until they are properly docile and stupid and `well-socialized'.

<p>So hackers tend to believe they have good reason for skepticism about
clinical explanations of the hacker personality.  That being said,
most would also concede that some hacker traits coincide with
indicators for ADD and AS - the status of caffeeine as a hacker
beverage of choice may be connected to the fact that it bonds to the
same neural receptors as Ritalin, the drug most commonly prescribed
for ADD.  It is probably true that boosters of both would find a
rather higher rate of clinical ADD among hackers than the supposedly
mainstream-normal 3-5% (AS is rarer and there are not yet good
estimates of incidence as of 2000).

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>Hackers are more likely to have cats than dogs (in fact, it is widely
grokked that cats have the hacker nature).  Many drive incredibly
decrepit heaps and forget to wash them; richer ones drive spiffy
Porsches and RX-7s and then forget to have them washed.  Almost all
hackers have terribly bad handwriting, and often fall into the habit
of block-printing everything like junior draftsmen.

<h1>Helping Hacker Culture Grow</h1>

<p>If you enjoyed the Jargon File, please help the culture that created it grow
and flourish.  Here are several ways you can help:

<p>&#149; If you are a writer or journalist, don't say or write
<b><a href="#hacker">hacker</a></b> when you mean <b><a href="#cracker">cracker</a></b>.  If you work with writers or
journalists, educate them on this issue and push them to do the right
thing. If you catch a newspaper or magazine abusing the work `hacker',
write them and straighten them out (this appendix includes a model
letter).

<p>&#149; If you're a techie or computer hobbyist, get involved with
one of the free Unixes.  Toss out that lame Microsoft OS, or confine
it to one disk partition and put Linux or FreeBSD or NetBSD on the
other one.  And the next time your friend or boss is thinking about
some proprietary software `solution' that costs more than it's worth,
be ready to blow the competition away with open-source software running
over a Unix.

<p>&#149; Contribute to organizations like the Free Software
Foundation that promote the production of high-quality free and
open-source software.  You can reach the Free Software Foundation at
<i>gnu@gnu.org</i>, by phone at +1-617-542-5942, or by
snail-mail at 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307
USA.

<p>&#149; Support the League for Programming Freedom, which opposes
over-broad software patents that constantly threaten to blow up in
hackers' faces, preventing them from developing innovative software
for tomorrow's needs.  You can reach the League for Programming Freedom at
<i>lpf@uunet.uu.net</i>. by phone at +1 617 621 7084, or by snail-mail at

<p>Here's the text of a letter RMS wrote to the Wall Street Journal to
complain about their policy of using "hacker" only in a pejorative
sense.  We hear that most major newspapers have the same policy.  If
you'd like to help change this situation, send your favorite newspaper
the same letter - or, better yet, write your own letter.

<blockquote>
Dear Editor:

<p>This letter is not meant for publication, although you can publish it
if you wish.  It is meant specifically for you, the editor, not the
public.

<p>I am a hacker.  That is to say, I enjoy playing with
computers -- working with, learning about, and writing clever computer
programs.  I am not a cracker; I don't make a practice of breaking
computer security.

<p>There's nothing shameful about the hacking I do.  But when I tell
people I am a hacker, people think I'm admitting something
naughty -- because newspapers such as yours misuse the word "hacker",
giving the impression that it means "security breaker" and nothing
else.  You are giving hackers a bad name.

<p>The saddest thing is that this problem is perpetuated deliberately. 
Your reporters know the difference between "hacker" and "security
breaker".  They know how to make the distinction, but you don't let
them!  You insist on using "hacker" pejoratively.  When reporters try
to use another word, you change it.  When reporters try to explain the
other meanings, you cut it.

<p>Of course, you have a reason.  You say that readers have become used
to your insulting usage of "hacker", so that you cannot change it now. 
Well, you can't undo past mistakes today; but that is no excuse to
repeat them tomorrow.

<p>If I were what you call a "hacker", at this point I would threaten to
crack your computer and crash it.  But I am a hacker, not a cracker. 
I don't do that kind of thing!  I have enough computers to play with
at home and at work; I don't need yours.  Besides, it's not my way to
respond to insults with violence.  My response is this letter.

<p>You owe hackers an apology; but more than that, you owe us ordinary
respect.

<p>			Sincerely, etc.

Steven Levy<br>
Anchor/Doubleday 1984<br>

<p>Levy's book is at its best in describing the early MIT hackers at the
Model Railroad Club and the early days of the microcomputer
revolution.  He never understood Unix or the networks, though, and his
enshrinement of Richard Stallman as "the last true hacker" turns out
(thankfully) to have been quite misleading.  Despite being a bit dated
and containing some minor errors (many fixed in the paperback
edition), this remains a useful and stimulating book that captures the
feel of several important hacker subcultures.

Stan Kelly-Bootle<br>
MIT Press, 1995<br>
ISBN 0-262-61112-0

<p>This pastiche of Ambrose Bierce's famous work is similar in format to
the Jargon File (and quotes several entries from TNHD-2) but somewhat
different in tone and intent.  It is more satirical and less
anthropological, and is largely a product of the author's literate and
quirky imagination.  For example, it defines `computer science' as
"a study akin to numerology and astrology, but lacking the precision
of the former and the success of the latter" and `implementation'
as "The fruitless struggle by the talented and underpaid to fulfill
promises made by the rich and ignorant"; `flowchart' becomes "to
obfuscate a problem with esoteric cartoons".  Revised and expanded
from "The Devil's DP Dictionary", McGraw-Hill 1981, ISBN
0-07-034022-6; that work had some stylistic influence on TNHD-1.

ISBN 0-393-30732-8

<p>The author of this pioneering compendium knits together a great deal
of computer- and hacker-related folklore with good writing and a few
well-chosen cartoons.  She has a keen eye for the human aspects of the
lore and is very good at illuminating the psychology and evolution of
hackerdom.  Unfortunately, a number of small errors and awkwardnesses
suggest that she didn't have the final manuscript checked over by a
native speaker; the glossary in the back is particularly embarrassing,
and at least one classic tale (the Magic Switch story, retold here
under <b><a href="#A%20Story%20About%20Magic">A Story About Magic</a></b> in Appendix A is given in
incomplete and badly mangled form.  Nevertheless, this book is a win

(paperback: Avon, 1982<br>
ISBN 0-380-59931-7)

<p>This book (a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winner) documents the adventure of
the design of a new Data General computer, the MV-8000 Eagle.  It is
an amazingly well-done portrait of the hacker mindset -- although
largely the hardware hacker -- done by a complete outsider.  It is a
bit thin in spots, but with enough technical information to be
entertaining to the serious hacker while providing non-technical
people a view of what day-to-day life can be like -- the fun, the
excitement, the disasters.  During one period, when the microcode and
logic were glitching at the nanosecond level, one of the overworked
engineers departed the company, leaving behind a note on his terminal
as his letter of resignation: "I am going to a commune in Vermont and
will deal with no unit of time shorter than a season."

ISBN 0-13-536657-7

<p>The authors of this book set out to tell you all the things about Unix
that tutorials and technical books won't.  The result is gossipy,
funny, opinionated, downright weird in spots, and invaluable.  Along
the way they expose you to enough of Unix's history, folklore and
humor to qualify as a first-class source for these things.  Because so
much of today's hackerdom is involved with Unix, this in turn
illuminates many of its in-jokes and preoccupations.

<p>Hacker demigod Richard Stallman used to say that the title story of
this book "expresses the spirit of hacking best".  Until the subject
of the next entry came out, it was hard to even nominate another
contender.  The other stories in this collection are also fine work by
an author who has since won multiple Hugos and is one of today's very
best practitioners of hard SF.

Neal Stephenson<br>
Bantam, 1992<br>
ISBN 0-553-56261-4

<p>Stephenson's epic, comic cyberpunk novel is deeply knowing about the
hacker psychology and its foibles in a way no other author of fiction
has ever even approached.  His imagination, his grasp of the relevant
technical details, and his ability to communicate the excitement of
hacking and its results are astonishing, delightful, and (so far)
unsurpassed.

Katie Hafner &amp; John Markoff<br>
Simon &amp; Schuster 1991<br>
ISBN 0-671-68322-5

<p>This book gathers narratives about the careers of three notorious
crackers into a clear-eyed but sympathetic portrait of hackerdom's
dark side.  The principals are Kevin Mitnick, "Pengo" and
"Hagbard" of the Chaos Computer Club, and Robert T. Morris (see
<b><a href="#RTM">RTM</a></b>, sense 2) .  Markoff and Hafner focus as much on their
psychologies and motivations as on the details of their exploits, but
don't slight the latter.  The result is a balanced and fascinating
account, particularly useful when read immediately before or after
Cliff Stoll's <b><a href="#The%20Cuckoo's%20Egg">The Cuckoo's Egg</a></b>.  It is especially instructive to
compare RTM, a true hacker who blundered, with the sociopathic
phone-freak Mitnick and the alienated, drug-addled crackers who made
the Chaos Club notorious.  The gulf between <b><a href="#wizard">wizard</a></b> and
<b><a href="#wannabee">wannabee</a></b> has seldom been made more obvious.

John Barry<br>
MIT Press 1991<br>
ISBN 0-262-02333-4

<p>Barry's book takes a critical and humorous look at the `technobabble'
of acronyms, neologisms, hyperbole, and metaphor spawned by the
computer industry.  Though he discusses some of the same mechanisms of
jargon formation that occur in hackish, most of what he chronicles is
actually suit-speak -- the obfuscatory language of press releases,
marketroids, and Silicon Valley CEOs rather than the playful jargon of
hackers (most of whom wouldn't be caught dead uttering the kind of
pompous, passive-voiced word salad he deplores).

Clifford Stoll<br>
Doubleday 1989<br>
ISBN 0-385-24946-2

<p>Clifford Stoll's absorbing tale of how he tracked Markus Hess and the
Chaos Club cracking ring nicely illustrates the difference between
`hacker' and `cracker'.  Stoll's portrait of himself, his lady Martha,
and his friends at Berkeley and on the Internet paints a marvelously
vivid picture of how hackers and the people around them like to live
and how they think.
