POST
There have been a number of threads here about a bootable CD to build LFS, so here's my version.
This is the prebuild iso image:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ut7v7sgobgykyu/bootcd-8.0.iso

This can be used 'as is' for VBox or burnt to DVD for a 'real' computer.
Both 64 bit ( default ) and 32 bit systems can be built, just follow the onscreen instructions.
Full source archives are included on the iso along with pre-built 64 and 32 bit tools, also included are the source files for wget/openssl and complete build scripts for my lfspkg package manager.

Login as root ( no password ), type[code]Instructions[/code] and then follow the onscreen guide, I would suggest opening another console ( ATL-F2 ) and run the commands from there, gpm is installed so you can copy/paste with the mouse.

If all goes well at the end you will have a bootable LFS installed, you can then carry on and install xorg etc as you want.

If you want to change/add stuff to the iso you can download the all the source files like so:[code]git clone https://github.com/KeithDHedger/LFSBootCD.git
./getSources[/code]

The getSources sscript will download some large external files:
64bit tools.
32bit tools.
64bit system ( for iso ).
32bit system ( for iso ).
Source files for LFS.
Source files for wget/openssl/unzip.
Source files for lfspkg manager.

The tools and system archives only need to be downloaded once.

Most non exectuable extras should be put in the cdtree folder, executables and data should go in the relevent xtras* folders, anthing in the xtrasanyarch folder will be added to BOTH 32bit and 64bit system.

After making any changes follow the instruction in the README.md file to rebuild the new system.

Let me know what you think.
Enjoy!
